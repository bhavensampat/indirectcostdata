  AGREEMENT DATE: August 22, 2005

                                                                                                                                        SECTION III:  GENERAL

   A.  LIMITATIONS:
   The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory or administrative
   limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other agreement only to
   the extent that funds are available. Acceptance of the rates is subject to
   the following conditions:
   (1) Only costs incurred by the organization were included in its indirect
   cost pool as finally accepted: such costs are legal
   obligations of the organization and are allowable under the governing cost
   principles; (2) The same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are
   not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar types of costs have been accorded
   consistent accounting treatment; and (4) The information provided by the
   organization which was used to establish the rates is not later found to be
   materially incomplete or inaccurate by the Federal Government. In such
   situations the rate(s) would be subject to renegotiation at the discretion
   of the Federal Government.


   B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:
   This Agreement is based on the accounting system purported by the
   organization to be in effect during the Agreement period. Changes
   to the method of accounting for costs which affect the amount of
   reimbursement resulting from the use of this Agreement require
   prior approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant agency.
   Such changes include, but are not limited to, changes in
   the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct. Failure
   to obtain approval may result in cost disallowances.

   C.  FIXED RATES:
   If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an estimate of the
   costs for the period covered by the rate. When the actual
   costs for this period are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate
   of a future year(s) to compensate for the difference
   between the costs used to establish the fixed rate and actual costs.

   D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:
   The rates in this Agreement were approved in accordance with the cost
   principles promulgated by the Department of Health and
   Human Services, and should be applied to the grants, contracts and other
   agreements covered by these regulations subject to
   any limitations in A above. The hospital may provide copies of the
   Agreement to other Federal Agencies to give them early notification of the
   Agreement.


   E.  OTHER:
   If any Federal contract, grant or other agreement is reimbursing indirect
   costs by a means other than the approved rate(s) in this
   Agreement, the organization should (1) credit such costs to the affected
   programs, and (2) apply the approved rate(s) to the
   appropriate base to identify the proper amount of indirect costs allocable
   to these programs.
