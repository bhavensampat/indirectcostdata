                                                                                                                                   SECTION II:  SPECIAL REMARKS

   TREATMENT OF FRINGE BENEFITS:                               
   This organization charges the actual cost of each fringe benefit direct to 
   Federal projects.  However, it uses a fringe benefit rate which is applied 
   to salaries and wages in budgeting fringe benefit costs under project      
   proposals.  The fringe benefits listed below are treated as direct costs.  

   TREATMENT OF PAID ABSENCES:                             
   Vacation, holiday, sick leave pay and other paid absences are included in  
   salaries and wages and are claimed on grants, contracts and other          
   agreements as part of the normal cost for salaries and wages.  Separate    
   claims for the costs of these paid absences are not made.                  

   OFF-SITE DEFINITION:  For all activities performed in facilities not owned 
   by the organization and to which rent is directly allocated to the         
   project(s), the off-site rate will apply.  Actual costs will be apportioned
   between on-site and off-site components.  Each portion will bear the       
   appropriate rate.                                                          

   DEFINITION OF EQUIPMENT                                                    
   Equipment is defined as tangible non-expendable personal property having a 
   useful life of more than on year and an acquisition cost of $1,000 or more.
                                                                              
   The following fringe benefits are treated as direct costs:                 
   FICA, STATE UNEMPLOYMENT, MEDICAL/LIFE INSURANCE, LONG-TERM DISABILITY,    
   STATE INDUSTRIAL COMPENSATION, AND RETIREMENT.

  AGREEMENT DATE: September  5, 2003
                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                        SECTION III:  GENERAL

   A.  LIMITATIONS:                  
   The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory or administrative 
   limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other agreement only to
   the extent that funds are available. Acceptance of the rates is subject to 
   the following conditions:                                                  
   (1) Only costs incurred by the organization were included in its indirect  
   cost pool as finally accepted: such costs are legal                        
   obligations of the organization and are allowable under the governing cost 
   principles; (2) The same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are
   not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar types of costs have been accorded 
   consistent accounting treatment; and (4) The information provided by the   
   organization which was used to establish the rates is not later found to be
   materially incomplete or inaccurate by the Federal Government. In such     
   situations the rate(s) would be subject to renegotiation at the discretion 
   of the Federal Government.                                                 
                                                                              

   B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:                         
   This Agreement is based on the accounting system purported by the          
   organization to be in effect during the Agreement period. Changes          
   to the method of accounting for costs which affect the amount of           
   reimbursement resulting from the use of this Agreement require             
   prior approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant agency.   
   Such changes include, but are not limited to, changes in                   
   the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct. Failure 
   to obtain approval may result in cost disallowances.                       

   C.  FIXED RATES:                  
   If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an estimate of the    
   costs for the period covered by the rate. When the actual                  
   costs for this period are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate 
   of a future year(s) to compensate for the difference                       
   between the costs used to establish the fixed rate and actual costs.       

   D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:                                    
   The rates in this Agreement were approved in accordance with the cost      
   principles promulgated by the Department of Health and                     
   Human Services, and should be applied to the grants, contracts and other   
   agreements covered by these regulations subject to                         
   any limitations in A above. The hospital may provide copies of the         
   Agreement to other Federal Agencies to give them early notification of the 
   Agreement.
