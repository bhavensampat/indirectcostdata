  AGREEMENT DATE: April 10, 2006
                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                        SECTION III:  GENERAL

   A.  LIMITATIONS:                  
   The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory or administrative 
   limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other agreement only to
   the extent that funds are available. Acceptance of the rates is subject to 
   the following conditions:                                                  
   (1) Only costs incurred by the organization were included in its indirect  
   cost pool as finally accepted: such costs are legal                        
   obligations of the organization and are allowable under the governing cost 
   principles; (2) The same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are
   not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar types of costs have been accorded 
   consistent accounting treatment; and (4) The information provided by the   
   organization which was used to establish the rates is not later found to be
   materially incomplete or inaccurate by the Federal Government. In such     
   situations the rate(s) would be subject to renegotiation at the discretion 
   of the Federal Government.                                                 
                                                                              

   B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:                         
   This Agreement is based on the accounting system purported by the          
   organization to be in effect during the Agreement period. Changes          
   to the method of accounting for costs which affect the amount of           
   reimbursement resulting from the use of this Agreement require             
   prior approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant agency.   
   Such changes include, but are not limited to, changes in                   
   the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct. Failure 
   to obtain approval may result in cost disallowances.                       

   C.  FIXED RATES:                  
   If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an estimate of the    
   costs for the period covered by the rate. When the actual                  
   costs for this period are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate 
   of a future year(s) to compensate for the difference                       
   between the costs used to establish the fixed rate and actual costs.       

   D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:                                    
   The rates in this Agreement were approved in accordance with the authority 
   in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-122 Circular, and should be  
   applied to grants, contracts and other agreements covered by this Circular,
   subject to any limitations in A above. The organization may provide copies 
   of the Agreement to other Federal Agencies to give them early notification 
   of the Agreement.                                                          
                                                                              

   E.  OTHER:            
   If any Federal contract, grant or other agreement is reimbursing indirect  
   costs by a means other than the approved rate(s) in this                   
   Agreement, the organization should (1) credit such costs to the affected   
   programs, and (2) apply the approved rate(s) to the                        
   appropriate base to identify the proper amount of indirect costs allocable 
   to these programs.
