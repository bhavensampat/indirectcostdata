AGREEMENT DATE: June 1, 2005
                                                                                       
SECTION III:  GENERAL                                                                  

A.  LIMITATIONS:  The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory or
administrative limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other agreement only
to the extent that funds are available.  Acceptance of the rates is subject to the
following conditions:   (1) Only costs incurred by the organization were included in
its indirect cost pool as finally accepted; such costs are legal obligations of the
organization and are allowable under the governing cost principles; (2) The same costs
that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar
types of costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) The
information provided by the organization which was used to establish the rates is not
later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate by the Federal Government.  In
such situations the rate(s) would be subject to renegotiation at the discretion of the
Federal Government.

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  This Agreement is based on the accounting system purported by
the organization to be in effect during the Agreement period.  Changes to the method of
accounting for costs which affect the amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of
this Agreement require prior approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant
agency.  Such changes include, but are not limited to, changes in the charging of a
particular type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure to obtain approval may result
in cost disallowances.

C.  FIXED RATES:  If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an estimate of
the costs for the period covered by the rate.  When the actual costs for this period
are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate of a future year(s) to compensate
for the difference between the costs used to establish the fixed rate and actual costs.

D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates in this Agreement were approved in
accordance with the authority in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-122
Circular, and should be applied to grants, contracts and other agreements covered by
these regulations, subject to any limitations in A above.  The organization may provide
copies of the Agreement to other Federal Agencies to give them early notification of
the Agreement.

Dear Ms.  Spears:

The original and one copy of a revised indirect cost Negotiation Agreement are
enclosed.  This Agreement reflects an understanding reached between your
organization and a member of my staff concerning the rate(s) that may be used to
support your claim for indirect costs on grants and contracts with the Federal Govern-

ment.  This agreement is  performed in accordance with PSC Interagency Agreement
DCA-3 with the Corporation for National and Community Service.  Please have the
original signed by a duly authorized representative of your organization and return it to
me, retaining the copy for your files.  We will reproduce and distribute the Agreement to
the appropriate awarding organizations of the Federal Government for their use.

An indirect cost proposal together with required supporting information must be
submitted to this office for each fiscal year in which your organization claims indirect
costs under grants and contracts awarded by the Federal Government.  Thus, your next
proposal based on your fiscal year ending June 30, 2004, is due in our office by
December 31, 2004.

                              Sincerely,



                              David S. Low
