AGREEMENT DATE: November 7, 2005
                                                                                       
SECTION III:  GENERAL                                                                  

A.  LIMITATIONS:  The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory or
administrative limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other agreement only
to the extent that funds are available.  Acceptance of the rates is subject to the
following conditions:   (1) Only costs incurred by the organization were included in
its indirect cost pool as finally accepted; such costs are legal obligations of the
organization and are allowable under the governing cost principles; (2) The same costs
that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar
types of costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) The
information provided by the organization which was used to establish the rates is not
later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate by the Federal Government.  In
such situations the rate(s) would be subject to renegotiation at the discretion of the
Federal Government.

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  This Agreement is based on the accounting system purported by
the organization to be in effect during the Agreement period.  Changes to the method of
accounting for costs which affect the amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of
this Agreement require prior approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant
agency.  Such changes include, but are not limited to, changes in the charging of a
particular type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure to obtain approval may result
in cost disallowances.

C.  FIXED RATES:  If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an estimate of
the costs for the period covered by the rate.  When the actual costs for this period
are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate of a future year(s) to compensate
for the difference between the costs used to establish the fixed rate and actual costs.

D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates in this Agreement were approved in
accordance with the authority in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-122
Circular, and should be applied to grants, contracts and other agreements covered by
these regulations, subject to any limitations in A above.  The organization may provide
copies of the Agreement to other Federal Agencies to give them early notification of
the Agreement.
