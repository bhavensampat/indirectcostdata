   TREATMENT OF FRINGE BENEFITS:                               
   The fringe benefits are charged using the rate(s) listed in the Fringe     
   Benefits Section of this Agreement.  The fringe benefits included in the   
   rate(s) are listed below.                                                  
                                                                              
                                                                              

   TREATMENT OF PAID ABSENCES:                             
   Vacation, holiday, sick leave pay and other paid absences are included in  
   salaries and wages and are claimed on grants, contracts and other          
   agreements as part of the normal cost for salaries and wages.  Separate    
   claims for the costs of these paid absences are not made.                  
                                                                              

   (1) Off-Campus Activity:                                                   
                                                                              
   a. Activities are considered to be off-site when the project or program is 
   conducted wholly on premises owned and operated by a Federal Agency such as
   research being conducted at the Veteran's Administration Hospital in       
   Albany, New York.                                                          
                                                                              
   b. Activities are considered to be off-site when the project or program is 
   conducted wholly on premises owned or leased by the College and operated by
   the College, but at a remote location from the College area.               
                                                                              
   c. Projects partially performed off-site are not apportioned between their 
   on-site and off-site components.  If 50% or more of the indirect cost rate 
   base costs of the project are determined to be on-site, the entire project 
   is treated as on-site.  If less than 50% of the indirect cost rate costs   
   are determined to be on site, the entire project is rated as off-site.     
                                                                              
   (2) The fringe benefit costs listed below are reimbursed to the grantee    
   through the direct fringe benefit rate:  Social Security Taxes (FICA),     
   Major Medical, Long-Term Disability, Life Insurance, A.M.C. Pension,       
   T.I.A.A. Pension, Tuition Remission, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Health        
   Service, Worker's Compensation, Unemployment Insurance, Short-Term         
   Disability, Educational Grant Program, Flexible Benefit Program and        
   Personal Leave Payouts.                                                    
                                                                              
   (3) Equipment means an article of nonexpendable tangible personal property 
   having a useful life of more than one year, and an acquisition cost of $500
   or more per unit.

  Albany Medical College of Union University        
                                                    

  AGREEMENT DATE: October 19, 1998
                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                        SECTION III:  GENERAL

   A.  LIMITATIONS:                  
   The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory or administrative 
   limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other agreement only to
   the extent that funds are available. Acceptance of the rates is subject to 
   the following conditions:                                                  
   (1) Only costs incurred by the organization were included in its facilities
   and administrative cost pools as finally accepted: such costs are legal    
   obligations of the organization and are allowable under the governing cost 
   principles; (2) The same costs that have been treated as facilities and    
   administrative costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar types of 
   costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) The      
   information provided by the organization which was used to establish the   
   rates is not later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate by the  
   Federal Government. In such situations the rate(s) would be subject to     
   renegotiation at the discretion of the Federal Government.                 
                                                                              

   B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:                         
   This Agreement is based on the accounting system purported by the          
   organization to be in effect during the Agreement period. Changes          
   to the method of accounting for costs which affect the amount of           
   reimbursement resulting from the use of this Agreement require             
   prior approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant agency.   
   Such changes include, but are not limited to, changes in                   
   the charging of a particular type of cost from facilities and              
   administrative to direct. Failure to obtain approval may result in cost    
   disallowances.                                                             
                                                                              

   C.  FIXED RATES:                  
   If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an estimate of the    
   costs for the period covered by the rate. When the actual                  
   costs for this period are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate 
   of a future year(s) to compensate for the difference                       
   between the costs used to establish the fixed rate and actual costs.       

   D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:                                    
   The rates in this Agreement were approved in accordance with the authority 
   in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21 Circular, and should be   
   applied to grants, contracts and other agreements covered by this Circular,
   subject to any limitations in A above. The organization may provide copies 
   of the Agreement to other Federal Agencies to give them early notification 
   of the Agreement.                                                          
                                                                              

   E.  OTHER:            
   If any Federal contract, grant or other agreement is reimbursing facilities
   and administrative costs by a means other than the approved rate(s) in this
   Agreement, the organization should (1) credit such costs to the affected   
   programs, and (2) apply the approved rate(s) to the appropriate base to    
   identify the proper amount of facilities and administrative costs allocable
   to these programs.
