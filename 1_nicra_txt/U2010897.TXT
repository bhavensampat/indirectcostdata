   TREATMENT OF FRINGE BENEFITS:                               
   The fringe benefits are charged using the rate(s) listed in the            
   Fringe Benefits Section of this Agreement.  The fringe benefits included in
   the rate(s) are listed below.                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              

   TREATMENT OF PAID ABSENCES:                             
   Other.  See Special Remarks Section of this Agreement.                     
                                                                              
                                                                              

   1.  The rates in this agreement have been negotiated                       
       to reflect the administrative cap provisions                           
       of the revision to OMB Circular A-21 published by the Office           
       of Management and Budget on October 3, 1991 and                        
       July 26, 1993. No rate affecting the institution's fiscal              
       periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991 contains total           
       administrative cost components in excess of that 26 percent            
       cap.                                                                   
                                                                              
   2.  These indirect cost rates apply when grants and contracts are          
       awarded jointly to Research Foundation of SUNY and University          
       Center at Buffalo.                                                     
                                                                              
   3.  For all activities performed in facilities not owned                   
       or leased by the organization or to which rent is directly             
       charged to the project(s), the off-site rate will apply.               
       Actual costs will be apportioned between on-site and                   
       off-site components. Each portion will bear the                        
       appropriate rate.                                                      
                                                                              
   4.  The fringe benefit costs listed below are reimbursed to the            
       grantee through the direct fringe benefit rates:

   *This component consists of payments for accrued unused vacation leave made
   in accordance with the Uniform Leave Policy to employees who have          
   terminated, changed accruing status, or transferred.  It also includes     
   payments for absences over 30 calendar-days that are charged to sick leave.
                                                                              
   5. Equipment means an article of nonexpendable, tangible                   
      personal property having a useful life of two years or

   6. Treatment of Paid Absences: *Vacation, holiday, sick leave              
      pay and other paid absences are included in salaries and                
      wages and are claimed on grants, contracts and other                    
      agreements as part of the normal cost for salaries and                  
      wages. Separate claims for the costs of these paid                      
      absences are not made.

  AGREEMENT DATE: February  3, 1997
                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                        SECTION III:  GENERAL

   A.  LIMITATIONS:                  
   The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory or administrative 
   limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other agreement only to
   the extent that funds are available. Acceptance of the rates is subject to 
   the following conditions:                                                  
   (1) Only costs incurred by the organization were included in its facilities
   and administrative cost pools as finally accepted: such costs are legal    
   obligations of the organization and are allowable under the governing cost 
   principles; (2) The same costs that have been treated as facilities and    
   administrative costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar types of 
   costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) The      
   information provided by the organization which was used to establish the   
   rates is not later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate by the  
   Federal Government. In such situations the rate(s) would be subject to     
   renegotiation at the discretion of the Federal Government.                 
                                                                              

   B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:                         
   This Agreement is based on the accounting system purported by the          
   organization to be in effect during the Agreement period. Changes          
   to the method of accounting for costs which affect the amount of           
   reimbursement resulting from the use of this Agreement require             
   prior approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant agency.   
   Such changes include, but are not limited to, changes in                   
   the charging of a particular type of cost from facilities and              
   administrative to direct. Failure to obtain approval may result in cost    
   disallowances.                                                             
                                                                              

   C.  FIXED RATES:                  
   If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an estimate of the    
   costs for the period covered by the rate. When the actual                  
   costs for this period are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate 
   of a future year(s) to compensate for the difference                       
   between the costs used to establish the fixed rate and actual costs.       

   D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:                                    
   The rates in this Agreement were approved in accordance with the authority 
   in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21 Circular, and should be   
   applied to grants, contracts and other agreements covered by this Circular,
   subject to any limitations in A above. The organization may provide copies 
   of the Agreement to other Federal Agencies to give them early notification 
   of the Agreement.                                                          
                                                                              

   E.  OTHER:            
   If any Federal contract, grant or other agreement is reimbursing facilities
   and administrative costs by a means other than the approved rate(s) in this
   Agreement, the organization should (1) credit such costs to the affected   
   programs, and (2) apply the approved rate(s) to the appropriate base to    
   identify the proper amount of facilities and administrative costs allocable
   to these programs.
