   AGREEMENT DATE: February  1, 2006

   TREATMENT OF FRINGE BENEFITS:                               
   The fringe benefits are charged using the rate(s) listed in the Fringe     
   Benefits Section of this Agreement.  The fringe benefits included in the   
   rate(s) are listed below.                                                  
                                                                              
                                                                              

   TREATMENT OF PAID ABSENCES:                             
   Vacation, holiday, sick leave pay and other paid absences are included in  
   salaries and wages and are claimed on grants, contracts and other          
   agreements as part of the normal cost for salaries and wages.  Separate    
   claims for the costs of these paid absences are not made.                  
                                                                              

   1. The rates in this Agreement have been negotiated to reflect the         
   administrative cap provisions of the revisions to OMB Circular A-21        
   published by the Office of Management and Budget on May 8, 1996.  No rate  
   affecting the institution's fiscal periods beginning on or after October 1,
   1991 contains total administrative cost components in excess of that 26    
   percent cap.                                                               
                                                                              
   2. For all activities performed in facilities not owned by the organization
   and to which rent is directly allocated to the project, the off-site rate  
   will apply.  Grants or contracts will not be subject to more than one      
   indirect cost rate.  If more than 50% of the project is performed off-site,
   the off-site rate will apply to the entire project.                        
                                                                              
   3. Fringe Benefits: Annual fringe benefits rates consisting of retirement  
   expenses, Social Security Taxes, Tuition Remission, Health Benefits, Dental
   Plan, Worker's Compensation, Disability Insurance, Group Life Insurance,   
   Unemployment Insurance, Sabbaticals and BUSM Campus Patrolman, shall apply 
   to direct salaries and wages in lieu of individual direct charges.  The    
   graduate student fringe benefit rate consists of student health plan costs 
   only.  Fringe benefits consisting of FICA and Worker's Compensation        
   insurance applicable to outside consultant services are also approved by   
   this Agreement.                                                            
                                                                              
   Effective 7/1/99 tuition support for dependents of Boston University       
   employees is no longer an allowable fringe benefit expense and is not      
   included in the approved rates.                                            
                                                                              
   4. The following rates shall be used to apportion occupancy related costs  
   to those grants and contracts awarded to Boston University but performed at
   Boston Medical Center.  These rates, together with the Off-Campus rates,   
   represent the full indirect costs applicable to Boston University effort at
   Boston Medical Center.

   *Base: Total direct costs excluding capital expenditures (buildings,       
   individual items of equipment; alterations and renovations) and subawards; 
   hospitalization and other fees associated with patient care whether the    
   services are obtained from an owned, related or third party hospital or    
   other medical facility; rental/maintenance of off-site activities; student 
   tuition remission and student support costs (e.g., student aid, stipends,  
   dependency allowances, scholarships, fellowships).                         
                                                                              
   5. Equipment means an article of nonexpendable, tangible personal property 
   having a useful life of more than one year, and an acquisition cost of     
   $5,000 or more per unit.

                                                                                                                                        SECTION III:  GENERAL

   A.  LIMITATIONS:                  
   The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory or administrative 
   limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other agreement only to
   the extent that funds are available. Acceptance of the rates is subject to 
   the following conditions:                                                  
   (1) Only costs incurred by the organization were included in its facilities
   and administrative cost pools as finally accepted: such costs are legal    
   obligations of the organization and are allowable under the governing cost 
   principles; (2) The same costs that have been treated as facilities and    
   administrative costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar types of 
   costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) The      
   information provided by the organization which was used to establish the   
   rates is not later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate by the  
   Federal Government. In such situations the rate(s) would be subject to     
   renegotiation at the discretion of the Federal Government.                 
                                                                              

   B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:                         
   This Agreement is based on the accounting system purported by the          
   organization to be in effect during the Agreement period. Changes          
   to the method of accounting for costs which affect the amount of           
   reimbursement resulting from the use of this Agreement require             
   prior approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant agency.   
   Such changes include, but are not limited to, changes in                   
   the charging of a particular type of cost from facilities and              
   administrative to direct. Failure to obtain approval may result in cost    
   disallowances.                                                             
                                                                              

   C.  FIXED RATES:                  
   If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an estimate of the    
   costs for the period covered by the rate. When the actual                  
   costs for this period are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate 
   of a future year(s) to compensate for the difference                       
   between the costs used to establish the fixed rate and actual costs.       

   D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:                                    
   The rates in this Agreement were approved in accordance with the authority 
   in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21 Circular, and should be   
   applied to grants, contracts and other agreements covered by this Circular,
   subject to any limitations in A above. The organization may provide copies 
   of the Agreement to other Federal Agencies to give them early notification 
   of the Agreement.                                                          
                                                                              

   E.  OTHER:            
   If any Federal contract, grant or other agreement is reimbursing facilities
   and administrative costs by a means other than the approved rate(s) in this
   Agreement, the organization should (1) credit such costs to the affected   
   programs, and (2) apply the approved rate(s) to the appropriate base to    
   identify the proper amount of facilities and administrative costs allocable
