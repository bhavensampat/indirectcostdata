   TREATMENT OF FRINGE BENEFITS:                               
   The fringe benefits are charged using the rate(s) listed in the Fringe     
   Benefits Section of this Agreement.  The fringe benefits included in the   
   rate(s) are listed below.                                                  
                                                                              
                                                                              

   TREATMENT OF PAID ABSENCES:                             
   Vacation, holiday, sick leave pay and other paid absences are included in  
   salaries and wages and are claimed on grants, contracts and other          
   agreements as part of the normal cost for salaries and wages.  Separate    
   claims for the costs of these paid absences are not made.                  
                                                                              

   1. The rates in this agreement have been negotiated to reflect the         
   administrative cap provisions to OMB Circular A-21 published by the Office 
   of Management and Budget on May 8, 1996. No rate affecting the             
   institution's fiscal periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991 contains
   total administrative cost components in excess of that 26 percent cap.     
                                                                              
   2. Equipment means an article of nonexpendable, tangible personal property 
   having a useful life of more than one year, and an acquisition cost of     
   $5,000 or more per unit.                                                   
                                                                              
   3. Activities Performed Partly-On, Partly-Off Campus: The University uses  
   the rate applicable to the location where the preponderance of the time and
   effort will be expended.  Accordingly, each contract or grant is assigned  
   only one indirect cost rate.                                               
                                                                              
   4. The following rates are applicable to research under a Harvard contract 
   or grant conducted at hospitals and medical facilities not affiliated with 
   Harvard for overhead reimbursement, i.e., cases where hospitals elect not  
   to submit indirect cost proposals for the recovery of space related        
   charges.  Typically, but not always, these hospitals are State             
   institutions:                                                              
                                                                              
   TYPE       FROM         TO          RATE         BASE                      
   PRED.    07-01-02    06-30-06       29.0%    MTDC as in Sec. I             
   PROV.    07-01-06   Until Amended  Use same rate as stated for             
                                      FYE 06-30-06                            
                                                                              
   5. The Off-Campus rates apply to effort conducted on premises not owned by 
   the University at locations sufficiently far removed from the campus to    
   prohibit the normal use of University facilities and services.             
                                                                              
   6. Fringe Benefits: The University distributes Fringe benefit costs to its 
   departments and sponsored activities (including Federal programs) on the   
   basis of annual rates applied to direct salaries and wages in lieu of      
   individual direct charges.  Over or under distribution of fringe benefit   
   costs are carried forward in estimating future rates.                      
                                                                              
   Inlcuded in the fringe benefit rates are: Pension, University Health       
   Services, FICA, Health and Dental Plans, Worker's Compensation,            
   Unemployment Compensation, Parking, Tuition Assistance (Employee Only),    
   Life Insurance, and Disability Insurance.                                  
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
   The approved fringe benefit rates are as follows:

  AGREEMENT DATE: February 22, 2006
                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                        SECTION III:  GENERAL

   A.  LIMITATIONS:                  
   The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory or administrative 
   limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other agreement only to
   the extent that funds are available. Acceptance of the rates is subject to 
   the following conditions:                                                  
   (1) Only costs incurred by the organization were included in its facilities
   and administrative cost pools as finally accepted: such costs are legal    
   obligations of the organization and are allowable under the governing cost 
   principles; (2) The same costs that have been treated as facilities and    
   administrative costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar types of 
   costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) The      
   information provided by the organization which was used to establish the   
   rates is not later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate by the  
   Federal Government. In such situations the rate(s) would be subject to     
   renegotiation at the discretion of the Federal Government.                 
                                                                              

   B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:                         
   This Agreement is based on the accounting system purported by the          
   organization to be in effect during the Agreement period. Changes          
   to the method of accounting for costs which affect the amount of           
   reimbursement resulting from the use of this Agreement require             
   prior approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant agency.   
   Such changes include, but are not limited to, changes in                   
   the charging of a particular type of cost from facilities and              
   administrative to direct. Failure to obtain approval may result in cost    
   disallowances.                                                             
                                                                              

   C.  FIXED RATES:                  
   If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an estimate of the    
   costs for the period covered by the rate. When the actual                  
   costs for this period are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate 
   of a future year(s) to compensate for the difference                       
   between the costs used to establish the fixed rate and actual costs.       

   D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:                                    
   The rates in this Agreement were approved in accordance with the authority 
   in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21 Circular, and should be   
   applied to grants, contracts and other agreements covered by this Circular,
   subject to any limitations in A above. The organization may provide copies 
   of the Agreement to other Federal Agencies to give them early notification 
   of the Agreement.                                                          
                                                                              

   E.  OTHER:            
   If any Federal contract, grant or other agreement is reimbursing facilities
   and administrative costs by a means other than the approved rate(s) in this
   Agreement, the organization should (1) credit such costs to the affected
