   TREATMENT OF PAID ABSENCES:                             
   Vacation, holiday, sick leave pay and other paid absences are included in  
   salaries and wages and are claimed on grants, contracts and other          
   agreements as part of the normal cost for salaries and wages.  Separate    
   claims are not made for the costs of these paid absences.                  

                                                                              
   OFF-CAMPUS DEFINITION: For all activities performed in facilities not owned
   by the institution and to which rent is directly allocated to the          
   project(s), the off-campus rate will apply. Grants or contracts will not be
   subject to more than one F&A cost rate.  If more than 50% of a project is  
   performed off-campus, the off-campus rate will apply to the entire project.
                                                                              

   TREATMENT OF FRINGE BENEFITS:                                              
                                                                              
   This organization uses fringe benefit rates for estimating direct fringe   
   benefit costs on grant applications and contract proposals.                
                                                                              
   For cash claims and final reporting purposes, the following fringe benefits
   are specifically identified to each employee and charged individually as   
   direct costs:  FICA/Medicare, Medical Insurance, Life Insurance, Long-Term 
   Disability, Tuition Remission and Retirement costs of active employees.    
   All other fringe benefits are charged using the rates published in Section 
   I of this Rate Agreement.                                                  
                                                                              
   The benefits covered by the rates listed in Section I are Workers'         
   Compensation, Unemployment Compensation, Severence/Terminal Leave Pay,     
   Short-Term Disability and Associated Benefits and Administrative Costs     
   Charged by the North Carolina Flex Plan.                                   
                                                                              
   Equipment means an article of nonexpendable tangible personal property     
   having a useful life of more than one year, and an acquisition cost of     
   $5,000 or more per unit.

  AGREEMENT DATE: June  6, 2006
                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                        SECTION III:  GENERAL

   A.  LIMITATIONS:                  
   The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory or administrative 
   limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other agreement only to
   the extent that funds are available. Acceptance of the rates is subject to 
   the following conditions:                                                  
   (1) Only costs incurred by the organization were included in its facilities
   and administrative cost pools as finally accepted: such costs are legal    
   obligations of the organization and are allowable under the governing cost 
   principles; (2) The same costs that have been treated as facilities and    
   administrative costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar types of 
   costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) The      
   information provided by the organization which was used to establish the   
   rates is not later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate by the  
   Federal Government. In such situations the rate(s) would be subject to     
   renegotiation at the discretion of the Federal Government.                 
                                                                              

   B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:                         
   This Agreement is based on the accounting system purported by the          
   organization to be in effect during the Agreement period. Changes          
   to the method of accounting for costs which affect the amount of           
   reimbursement resulting from the use of this Agreement require             
   prior approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant agency.   
   Such changes include, but are not limited to, changes in                   
   the charging of a particular type of cost from facilities and              
   administrative to direct. Failure to obtain approval may result in cost    
   disallowances.                                                             
                                                                              

   C.  FIXED RATES:                  
   If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an estimate of the    
   costs for the period covered by the rate. When the actual                  
   costs for this period are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate 
   of a future year(s) to compensate for the difference                       
   between the costs used to establish the fixed rate and actual costs.       

   D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:                                    
   The rates in this Agreement were approved in accordance with the authority 
   in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21 Circular, and should be   
   applied to grants, contracts and other agreements covered by this Circular,
   subject to any limitations in A above. The organization may provide copies 
   of the Agreement to other Federal Agencies to give them early notification 
   of the Agreement.                                                          
                                                                              

   E.  OTHER:            
   If any Federal contract, grant or other agreement is reimbursing facilities
   and administrative costs by a means other than the approved rate(s) in this
   Agreement, the organization should (1) credit such costs to the affected   
   programs, and (2) apply the approved rate(s) to the appropriate base to    
   identify the proper amount of facilities and administrative costs allocable
   to these programs.
