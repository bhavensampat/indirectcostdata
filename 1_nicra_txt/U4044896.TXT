   AGREEMENT DATE: June 21, 1996

   TREATMENT OF FRINGE BENEFITS:                               
   The fringe benefits are charged using the rate(s) listed in the Fringe     
   Benefits Section of this Agreement.  The fringe benefits included in the   
   rate(s) are listed in the Special Remarks Section of this Agreement.       

   TREATMENT OF PAID ABSENCES:                             
   Vacation, holiday, sick leave pay and other paid absences are included in  
   salaries and wages and are claimed on grants, contracts and other          
   agreements as part of the normal cost for salaries and wages.  Separate    
   claims for the costs of these paid absences are not made.                  

   OFF-CAMPUS DEFINITION: For all activities performed in facilities not owned
   by the institution and to which rent is directly allocated to the          
   project(s) the off-campus rate will apply.  Grants or contracts will notbe 
   subject to more than one indirect cost rate.  If more than 50% of a project
   is performed off-campus, the off-campus rate will apply to the entire      
   project.                                                                   

   Fringe Benefits include:  FICA, Retirement, Disability Insurance, Life     
   Insurance, Faculty-Staff Tuition Waivers, Workers' Compensation,           
   Unemployment Insurance and Health Insurance.                               
                                                                              
   The rates in this agreement have been negotiated or revised, as            
   appropriate, to reflect the administrative cap provisions of the revision  
   to OMB Circular A-21 published by the Office of Management and Budget on   
   October 3, 1991.  No rate affecting the institution's fiscal periods       
   beginning on or after October 1, 1991 contains total administrative cost   
   components in excess of that 26 percent cap.                               
                                                                              
                                                                              
  ORGANIZATION:
  Virginia Commonwealth University                  
                                                    

  AGREEMENT DATE: June 21, 1996
                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                        SECTION III:  GENERAL

   A.  LIMITATIONS:                  
   The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory or administrative 
   limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other agreement only to
   the extent that funds are available. Acceptance of the rates is subject to 
   the following conditions:                                                  
   (1) Only costs incurred by the organization were included in its indirect  
   cost pool as finally accepted: such costs are legal                        
   obligations of the organization and are allowable under the governing cost 
   principles; (2) The same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are
   not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar types of costs have been accorded 
   consistent accounting treatment; and (4) The information provided by the   
   organization which was used to establish the rates is not later found to be
   materially incomplete or inaccurate by the Federal Government. In such     
   situations the rate(s) would be subject to renegotiation at the discretion 
   of the Federal Government.                                                 
                                                                              

   B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:                         
   This Agreement is based on the accounting system purported by the          
   organization to be in effect during the Agreement period. Changes          
   to the method of accounting for costs which affect the amount of           
   reimbursement resulting from the use of this Agreement require             
   prior approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant agency.   
   Such changes include, but are not limited to, changes in                   
   the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct. Failure 
   to obtain approval may result in cost disallowances.                       

   C.  FIXED RATES:                  
   If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an estimate of the    
   costs for the period covered by the rate. When the actual                  
   costs for this period are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate 
   of a future year(s) to compensate for the difference                       
   between the costs used to establish the fixed rate and actual costs.       

   D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:                                    
   The rates in this Agreement were approved in accordance with the authority 
   in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21 Circular, and should be   
   applied to grants, contracts and other agreements covered by this Circular,
   subject to any limitations in A above. The organization may provide copies 
   of the Agreement to other Federal Agencies to give them early notification 
   of the Agreement.                                                          
                                                                              

   E.  OTHER:            
   The rates in this Agreement were approved in accordance with the cost      
   principles promulgated by the Department of Health and                     
   Human Services, and should be applied to the grants, contracts and other   
   agreements covered by these regulations subject to                         
   any limitations in A above. The hospital may provide copies of the         
   Agreement to other Federal Agencies to give them early notification of the 
   Agreement.
