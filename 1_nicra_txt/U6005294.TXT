   AGREEMENT DATE: July  7, 1994
                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                   SECTION II:  SPECIAL REMARKS

   TREATMENT OF FRINGE BENEFITS:                               
   The fringe benefits are charged using a rate(s).  Over/under recoveries    
   from actual costs are adjusted in current or future periods.  The directly 
   claimed fringe benefits are listed in the Special Remarks section of this  
   Agreement.                                                                 

   The indirect cost reimbursement rates include the cost of administrative   
   and clerical staff, except those staff costs specifically approved by the  
   awarding agencies as appropriate direct charges to (major) projects or     
   activity.(See OMB interpretation letter of February 23, 1994)  The cost of 
   specifically approved administrative and clerical costs identified with    
   major projects or activity are included as part of the modified total      
   direct cost base.                                                          
                                                                              
   Off campus activities are considered "Off Campus" when the programs and    
   projects are performed in facilities not owned or maintained by the        
   College.  Programs and projects performed partially off campus are         
   apportioned between their on campus and off campus components.             
                                                                              
   This organization uses a fringe benefit rate for estimating direct fringe  
   benefit costs in grant applications and contract proposals.  For final     
   reporting, the cost of each benefit is specifically identified to each     
   employee and charged individually.  The following fringe benefits are      
   included in the fringe rate:                                               
          FICA                        Health and Life Insurance               
          Workers' Compensation       Unemployment Compensation               
          Retirement                  Tuition Remission                       
          University Discounts        .5% Payroll Tax                         
                                                                              
   The cost of vacation, holiday, sick leave, and other paid absences are     
   included in salaries and wages and are charged to grants and contracts as  
   part of the normal charge for salaries and wages.  Separate charges for the
   costs of these absences are not made.  However, certain large Research     
   Centers(i.e. NMERI), utilize a compensated leave benefit rates for         
   assessing projects for these costs.  Over/under recovery adjustments are   
   made in future rates.

  AGREEMENT DATE: July  7, 1994
                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                        SECTION III:  GENERAL

   A.  LIMITATIONS:                  
   The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory or administrative 
   limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other agreement only to
   the extent that funds are available. Acceptance of the rates is subject to 
   the following conditions:                                                  
   (1) Only costs incurred by the organization were included in its facilities
   and administrative cost pools as finally accepted: such costs are legal    
   obligations of the organization and are allowable under the governing cost 
   principles; (2) The same costs that have been treated as facilities and    
   administrative costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar types of 
   costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) The      
   information provided by the organization which was used to establish the   
   rates is not later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate by the  
   Federal Government. In such situations the rate(s) would be subject to     
   renegotiation at the discretion of the Federal Government.                 
                                                                              

   B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:                         
   This Agreement is based on the accounting system purported by the          
   organization to be in effect during the Agreement period. Changes          
   to the method of accounting for costs which affect the amount of           
   reimbursement resulting from the use of this Agreement require             
   prior approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant agency.   
   Such changes include, but are not limited to, changes in                   
   the charging of a particular type of cost from facilities and              
   administrative to direct. Failure to obtain approval may result in cost    
   disallowances.                                                             
                                                                              

   C.  FIXED RATES:                  
   If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an estimate of the    
   costs for the period covered by the rate. When the actual                  
   costs for this period are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate 
   of a future year(s) to compensate for the difference                       
   between the costs used to establish the fixed rate and actual costs.       

   D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:                                    
   The rates in this Agreement were approved in accordance with the authority 
   in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21 Circular, and should be   
   applied to grants, contracts and other agreements covered by this Circular,
   subject to any limitations in A above. The organization may provide copies 
   of the Agreement to other Federal Agencies to give them early notification 
   of the Agreement.                                                          
                                                                              

   E.  OTHER:            
   If any Federal contract, grant or other agreement is reimbursing facilities
   and administrative costs by a means other than the approved rate(s) in this
   Agreement, the organization should (1) credit such costs to the affected   
   programs, and (2) apply the approved rate(s) to the appropriate base to    
   identify the proper amount of facilities and administrative costs allocable
   to these programs.
