*BASE: Modified total direct costs, consisting of all salaries and wages, fringe
benefits, materials and supplies, services, travel, and subgrants and subcontracts up
to the first $25,000 of each subgrant or subcontract (regardless of the period covered
by the subgrant or subcontract).  Equipment, capital expenditures, charges for patient
care and tuition remission, rental costs, scholarships, and fellowships as well as the
portion of each subgrant and subcontract in excess of $25,000 shall be excluded from
modified total direct costs.

DEFINITION OF EQUIPMENT
Effective 07/01/97, equipment is defined as tangible non-expendable personal property
having a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $1000 or more.

TREATMENT OF PAID ABSENCES
Vacation, holiday, sick leave pay and other paid absences are included in salaries and
wages and are charged to Federal projects as part of the normal charge for salaries and
wages.  Separate charges for the cost of these absences are not made.

TREATMENT OF OTHER FRINGE BENEFITS
This organization charges the actual cost of each fringe benefit direct to
Federal projects.  However, it uses a fringe benefit rate which is applied to
salaries and wages in budgeting fringe benefit cost under project proposals.
The following fringe benefits are treated as direct costs:
FICA, ARIZONA STATE RETIREMENT, UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE, WORKERS COMPENSATION,
MEDICAL/DENTAL/LIFE AND DISABILITY INSURANCE.

SECTION II:  GENERAL

A.  LIMITATION:  The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory or
administrative limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other agreement
only to the extent that funds are available.  Acceptance of the rates is subject
to the following conditions:   (1) Only costs incurred by the organization were
included in its facilities and administrative cost pools as finally accepted; such
costs are legal obligations of the organization and are allowable under the
governing cost principles; (2) The same costs that have been treated as facilities
and administrative costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar types of
costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) The information
provided by the organization which was used to establish the rates is not later
found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:   If a fixed or predetermined rate is in this Agreement, 
it is based on  the accounting system purported by the organization to be in
effect during the Agreement period.  Changes to the method of accounting for costs
which affect the amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of this Agreement
require prior approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant agency. 
Such changes include, but are not limited to, changes in the charging of a
particular type of cost from facilities and administrative to direct.   Failure
to obtain approval may result in cost disallowances.

C.  FIXED RATES:  If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an estimate
of the costs for the period covered by the rate.  When the actual costs for this
period are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate of a future year(s)
to compensate for the difference between the costs used to establish the fixed
rate and actual costs.

D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:   The rates in this Agreement were approved in
accordance with the authority in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21 and
should be applied to grants, contracts and other agreements  covered  by  the 
appropriate  regulation,  subject  to  any limitations in A above.   The
organization may provide copies of this Agreement to other Federal Agencies to
give them early notification of this Agreement.
