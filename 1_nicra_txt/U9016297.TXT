SPECIAL REMARKS:

OFF-CAMPUS DEFINITION AND APPLICATION
The off-campus rate is applicable to those projects that are conducted in
facilities not owned or operated by the University and/or where the operations
and maintenance type costs are charged directly to a project.  A project is
considered off-campus if more than 50% of the project expenditures are related
to the off-campus activity and University space is not available.  If a project
is judged to be off-campus, it shall be considered wholly off-campus. Separate
on and off-campus rates will not be used for single project.

SECTION II :    GENERAL
									
A.  LIMITATION:  The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory
or administrative limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other
agreement only to the extent that funds are available.  Acceptance of the
rates is subject to the following conditions: (1) Only costs incurred by
the organization were included in its facilities and administrative cost
pools as finally accepted; such costs are legal obligations of the
organization and are allowable under the governing cost principles; (2) The
same costs that have been treated as facilities and administrative costs
are not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar types of costs have been
accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) The information provided
by the organization which was used to establish the rates is not later
found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES: If a fixed or predetermined rate is in this
Agreement, it is based on the accounting system purported by the
organization to be in effect during the Agreement period. Changes to the
method of accounting for costs which affect the amount of reimbursement
resulting from the use of this Agreement require prior approval of the
authorized representative of the cognizant agency. Such changes include,
but are not limited to, changes in the charging of a particular type of
cost from facilities and administrative to direct. Failure to obtain
approval may result in cost disallowances.

C.  FIXED RATES:  If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an
estimate of the costs for the period covered by the rate. When the actual
costs for this period are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate
of a future year(s) to compensate for the difference between the costs used
to establish the fixed rate and actual costs.

D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:   The rates in this Agreement were
approved in accordance with the authority in Office of Management and
Budget Circular A-21 and should be applied to grants, contracts and other
agreements covered by the appropriate regulation, subject to any
limitations in A above. The organization may provide copies of this
Agreement to other Federal Agencies to give them early notification of this
Agreement.
