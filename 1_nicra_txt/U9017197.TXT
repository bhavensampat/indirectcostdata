   Effective 7/1/95 this organization changed its treatment of Paid Absences  
   and Other Fringe Benefits as described below:                              
                                                                              
   TREATMENT OF PAID ABSENCES                                                 
   The cost of vacation and sick leave pay are included in the organization's 
   fringe benefit rate and are not included in direct charges for salaries and
   wages.  Charges for salaries and wages must exclude those paid to employees
   for periods when they are on vacation, or sick leave.                      
                                                                              
   TREATMENT OF OTHER FRINGE BENEFITS                                         
   This organization uses a fringe benefit rate which is applied to salaries  
   and wages for both budgeting and charging purposes for Federal projects.   
   The following fringe benefits are included in the fringe benefit rate:     
   RETIREE MEDICAL, ADMINISTRATION EXPENSES OF THE CAFETERIA PLAN, AND STATE  
   UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE                                                     
                                                                              
   TREATMENT OF OTHER FRINGE BENEFITS                                         
   This organization identified the cost of each fringe benefit separately as 
   a direct cost when budgeting and charging fringe benefits under federal    
   projects.  The following fringe benefits are treated as direct costs:      
   RETIREMENT, FICA, WORKERS COMPENSATION, HEALTH INSURANCE, STATE DISABILITY 
   INSURANCE, LONG-TERM DISABILITY INSURANCE, LIFE INSURANCE, AND ACCIDENTAL  
   DEATH AND DISMEMBERMENT INSURANCE                                          
                                                                              
   DEFINITION OF EQUIPMENT                                                    
   Effective  07/01/97 equipment is defined as tangible nonexpendable personal
   property having a useful life of more than one year, and an acquisition    
   cost of $5000 or more per unit.

  AGREEMENT DATE: May 30, 1997
                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                        SECTION III:  GENERAL

   A.  LIMITATIONS:                  
   The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory or administrative 
   limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other agreement only to
   the extent that funds are available. Acceptance of the rates is subject to 
   the following conditions:                                                  
   (1) Only costs incurred by the organization were included in its facilities
   and administrative cost pools as finally accepted: such costs are legal    
   obligations of the organization and are allowable under the governing cost 
   principles; (2) The same costs that have been treated as facilities and    
   administrative costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar types of 
   costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) The      
   information provided by the organization which was used to establish the   
   rates is not later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate by the  
   Federal Government. In such situations the rate(s) would be subject to     
   renegotiation at the discretion of the Federal Government.                 
                                                                              

   B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:                         
   This Agreement is based on the accounting system purported by the          
   organization to be in effect during the Agreement period. Changes          
   to the method of accounting for costs which affect the amount of           
   reimbursement resulting from the use of this Agreement require             
   prior approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant agency.   
   Such changes include, but are not limited to, changes in                   
   the charging of a particular type of cost from facilities and              
   administrative to direct. Failure to obtain approval may result in cost    
   disallowances.                                                             
                                                                              

   C.  FIXED RATES:                  
   If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an estimate of the    
   costs for the period covered by the rate. When the actual                  
   costs for this period are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate 
   of a future year(s) to compensate for the difference                       
   between the costs used to establish the fixed rate and actual costs.       

   D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:                                    
   The rates in this Agreement were approved in accordance with the authority 
   in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21 Circular, and should be   
   applied to grants, contracts and other agreements covered by this Circular,
   subject to any limitations in A above. The organization may provide copies 
   of the Agreement to other Federal Agencies to give them early notification 
   of the Agreement.                                                          
                                                                              

   E.  OTHER:            
   If any Federal contract, grant or other agreement is reimbursing facilities
   and administrative costs by a means other than the approved rate(s) in this
   Agreement, the organization should (1) credit such costs to the affected   
   programs, and (2) apply the approved rate(s) to the appropriate base to    
   identify the proper amount of facilities and administrative costs allocable
   to these programs.
