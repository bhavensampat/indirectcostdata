                                                                                                                                   SECTION II:  SPECIAL REMARKS

   TREATMENT OF PAID ABSENCES                                                 
   For Foundation Regular Employees, the cost of Vacation and Other Paid      
   Absences (OPA) are included in a fringe benefit rate and are not included  
   in direct charges for salaries and wages.  Charges for salaries and wages  
   must exclude those paid to Foundation Regular Employees on Vacation or OPA.
                                                                              
   For Foundation employment categories other than Foundation Regular         
   Employees, Vacation and OPA are not provided.  Thus, charges separate from 
   salaries and wages are not made for this type of benefit.                  
                                                                              
   For University Employees, Vacation and OPA are included in salaries and    
   wages.  Separate claims for these costs are not made.  Faculty are released
   to the Foundation when working on Federal projects, and Vacation and OPA   
   are reimbursed by the Foundation to the University as part of the normal   
   charge for salaries and wages.                                             
                                                                              
   TREATMENT OF OTHER FRINGE BENEFITS                                         
   For Foundation Regular Employees, this organization uses a fringe benefit  
   rate which includes the costs of State Unemployment, Retiree Medical, and  
   Cafeteria Plan and is applied to salaries and wages for budgeting and      
   charging purposes for Federal projects.  Actual costs are used for charging
   purposes for the following fringe benefits:  FICA, Medicare, Workers       
   Compensation, Health/Life/Disability Insurance, and Retirement.            
                                                                              
   For Foundation employment categories other than Foundation Regular         
   Employees, the organization uses a fringe benefit rate which includes the  
   costs of State Unemployment and is applied to salaries and wages for       
   budgeting and charging purposes for Federal projects.  Actual costs are    
   used for charging purposes for the following fringe benefits:  FICA,       
   Medicare, and Workers Compensation.                                        
                                                                              
   For University Employees, a state calculated fringe benefit rate is used   
   for budgeting purposes for Federal projects.  Faculty are released to the  
   Foundation when working on Federal projects, and fringe benefits are       
   reimbursed by the Foundation to the University.  The following fringe      
   benefits are treated as direct costs:  SUI, Retirement, Workers            
   Compensation, Health Insurance, SDI, and Life Insurance.                   
                                                                              
   DEFINITION OF EQUIPMENT                                                    
   Effective  07/01/97 equipment is defined as tangible nonexpendable personal
   property having a useful life of more than one year, and an acquisition    
   cost of $5,000 or more per unit.                                           
                                                                              
                                                                              
   This rate agreement updates the fringe benefits only.

  AGREEMENT DATE: October  2, 1997
                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                        SECTION III:  GENERAL

   A.  LIMITATIONS:                  
   The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory or administrative 
   limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other agreement only to
   the extent that funds are available. Acceptance of the rates is subject to 
   the following conditions:                                                  
   (1) Only costs incurred by the organization were included in its facilities
   and administrative cost pools as finally accepted: such costs are legal    
   obligations of the organization and are allowable under the governing cost 
   principles; (2) The same costs that have been treated as facilities and    
   administrative costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar types of 
   costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) The      
   information provided by the organization which was used to establish the   
   rates is not later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate by the  
   Federal Government. In such situations the rate(s) would be subject to     
   renegotiation at the discretion of the Federal Government.                 
                                                                              

   B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:                         
   This Agreement is based on the accounting system purported by the          
   organization to be in effect during the Agreement period. Changes          
   to the method of accounting for costs which affect the amount of           
   reimbursement resulting from the use of this Agreement require             
   prior approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant agency.   
   Such changes include, but are not limited to, changes in                   
   the charging of a particular type of cost from facilities and              
   administrative to direct. Failure to obtain approval may result in cost    
   disallowances.                                                             
                                                                              

   C.  FIXED RATES:                  
   If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an estimate of the    
   costs for the period covered by the rate. When the actual                  
   costs for this period are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate 
   of a future year(s) to compensate for the difference                       
   between the costs used to establish the fixed rate and actual costs.       

   D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:                                    
   The rates in this Agreement were approved in accordance with the authority 
   in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21 Circular, and should be   
   applied to grants, contracts and other agreements covered by this Circular,
   subject to any limitations in A above. The organization may provide copies 
   of the Agreement to other Federal Agencies to give them early notification 
   of the Agreement.                                                          
                                                                              

   E.  OTHER:            
   If any Federal contract, grant or other agreement is reimbursing facilities
   and administrative costs by a means other than the approved rate(s) in this
   Agreement, the organization should (1) credit such costs to the affected   
   programs, and (2) apply the approved rate(s) to the appropriate base to    
   identify the proper amount of facilities and administrative costs allocable
   to these programs.
