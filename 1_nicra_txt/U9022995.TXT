SECTION II:	TREATMENT OF FRINGE BENEFITS AND PAID ABSENCES

Treatment of Other Fringe Benefits

This organization charges the actual cost of each fringe benefit direct to
Federal projects.  However, it budgets fringe benefits on project proposals
by using a composite rate.  Following is the list of fringe benefits at the
University:

	Worker's Compensation              Disability Insurance
	Health Plan Contribution           Life Insurance
	Retirement System Contribution     Unemployment Insurance
 	FICA                               Dental Plan Contribution

Treatment of Paid Absences

Vacation, holiday, sick leave pay and other paid absences are included in
salaries and wages and are charged to Federal projects as part of the normal
charge for salaries and wages. Separate charges for the cost of these 
absences are not made.

SECTION III:	GENERAL

A.	LIMITATIONS: The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory or
administrative limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other
agreement only to the extent that funds are available. Acceptance of the
rates is subject to the following conditions:  (1) Only costs incurred by the
institution were included in its indirect cost pool as finally accepted; such
costs are legal obligations of the institution and are allowable under the
governing cost principles; (2) The same costs that have been treated as
indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar types of costs
have been accorded consistent accounting treatment, and (4) The information
provided by the institution which was used to establish the rates is not
later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.	ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  If a fixed or predetermined rate is in this
Agreement, it is based on the accounting system purported by the institution
to be in effect during the Agreement period.   Changes to the method of
accounting for costs which affect the amount of reimbursement resulting from
the use of this Agreement require the prior approval of the authorized
representative of the cognizant agency.  Such changes include, but are not
limited to, changes in the charging of a particular type of cost from
indirect to direct. Failure to obtain approval may result in cost
disallowances.

C.	FIXED RATES:  If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an
estimate of the costs for the period covered by the rate. When the actual
costs for this period are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate of
a future year(s) to compensate for the difference between the costs used to
establish the fixed rate and actual costs.

D.    USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates in this Agreement were approved
in accordance with the authority in Office of Management and Budget Circular
A-88, and should be applied to grants, contracts and other agreements covered
by Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21, subject to any limitations
in A above.  The institution may provide copies of the Agreement to other
Federal agencies to give them early notification of the Agreement.

E.	SPECIAL REMARKS:


(1)	Definition of On-Campus, Off-Campus and Special Rates

	a.   Definition of Off-Campus Rate

	     The off-campus rate is applicable to those projects conducted at
             facilities not owned or leased by the University.  However, if
             the project is conducted in leased space and the lease costs are
             directly charged to the project, then the off-campus rate must
             be used.

             Projects conducted entirely on-campus or entirely off-campus:
             Projects conducted entirely on-campus or entirely off-campus
             will be applied the on-campus or off-campus rate respectively.

             Projects conducted partially off-campus and partially on-campus:
             If the project involves work at both on-campus and off-campus
             sites, either the on-campus or off-campus rate generally should
             be applied, consistent with where the majority of the work is to
             be performed.  Salary cost is generally accepted as a measure of
             work performed in terms of the total project.

	b.   Use of Both On-Campus and Off-Campus Rates

             The use of both on-campus and off-campus rates for a given
             project may be justified if both of the respective rates can
             clearly be identified with a significant portion of salaries and
             wages of the project. For purposes  of this provision,
             significant is defined as approximately 25% or more of the total
             costs and a project's total salary and wage costs exceed
             $250,000.

	c.   Other Special Rates

             These rates apply only to the facility or program to which they
             are  identified. If any additional special rates become
             necessary the establishment of such rates should be coordinated
             through the cognizant negotiation agency.
