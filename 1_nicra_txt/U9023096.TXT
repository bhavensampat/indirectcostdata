SECTION II:	TREATMENT OF FRINGE BENEFITS AND PAID ABSENCES

Treatment of Other Fringe Benefits

This organization charges the actual cost of each fringe benefit direct to
Federal projects.  However, it budgets fringe benefits on project proposals
by using a composite rate.  Following is the list of fringe benefits at the
University:

	Worker's Compensation			Disability Insurance
	Health Plan Contribution		Life Insurance
	Retirement System Contribution		Unemployment Insurance
	FICA					Dental Plan Contribution

Treatment of Paid Absences

Vacation, holiday, sick leave pay and other paid absences are included in 
salaries and wages and are charged to Federal projects as part of the normal 
charge for salaries and wages. Separate charges for the cost of these 
absences are not made.

SECTION III:  GENERAL

A.    LIMITATIONS:  The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory or
administrative limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other 
agreement only to the extent that funds are available.  Acceptance of the 
rates is subject to the following conditions:  (1) Only costs incurred by the
institution were included in its indirect cost pool as finally accepted; such 
costs are legal obligations of the institution and are allowable under the 
governing cost principles; (2) The same costs that have been treated as 
indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar types of costs 
have been accorded consistent accounting treatment, and (4) The information 
provided by the institution which was used to establish the rates is not 
later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.	ACCOUNTING CHANGES:   If a fixed or predetermined rate is in this 
Agreement, it is based on the accounting system purported by the institution 
to be in effect during the Agreement period. Changes to the method of 
accounting for costs which affect the amount of reimbursement resulting from 
the use of this Agreement require the prior approval of the authorized 
representative of the cognizant agency.  Such changes include, but are not 
limited to, changes in the charging of a particular type of cost from 
indirect to direct.  Failure to obtain approval may result in cost 
disallowances.

C.	FIXED RATES:  If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an 
estimate of the costs for the period covered by the rate.  When the actual 
costs for this period are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate of 
a future year(s) to compensate for the difference between the costs used to 
establish the fixed rate and actual costs.

D.     USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates in this Agreement were approved 
in accordance with the authority in Office of Management and Budget Circular 
A-88, and should be applied to grants, contracts and other agreements covered 
by Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21, subject to any limitations 
in A above.  The institution may provide copies of the Agreement to other 
Federal agencies to give them early notification of the Agreement.

E.	SPECIAL REMARKS:

       (1)  Definition of On-Campus, Off-Campus and Special Rates

	    a.  Definition of Off-Campus Rate

		The off-campus rate is applicable to those projects conducted at
		facilities not owned or leased by the University.  However, if
                the project is conducted in leased space and the lease costs are
		directly charged to the project, then the off-campus rate must 
		be used.

		Projects conducted entirely on-campus or entirely off-campus:
		Projects conducted entirely on-campus or entirely off-campus 
		will be applied the on-campus or off-campus rate respectively.

		Projects conducted partially off-campus and partiall on-campus:
		If the project involves work at both on-campus and off-campus 
		sites, either the on-campus or off-campus rate generally should
                be applied, consistent with where the majority of the work is to
                be performed.  Salary cost is generally accepted as a measure of
                work performed in terms of the total project.

	    b.  Use of Both On-Campus and Off-Campus Rates

		The use of both on-campus and off-campus rates for a given 
                project may be justified if both of the respective rates can 
		clearly be identified with a significant portion of salaries and 
		wages of the project. For purposes of this provision, 
		significant is defined as approximately 25% or more of the total 
		costs and a project's total salary and wage costs exceed
                $250,000.

	 c.     Other Special Rates

		These rates apply only to the facility or program to which they 
		are identified.  If any additional special rates become 
		necessary the establishment of such rates should be coordinated 
		through the cognizant negotiation agency.
