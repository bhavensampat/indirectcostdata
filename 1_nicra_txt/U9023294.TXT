SECTION II:	TREATMENT OF FRINGE BENEFITS AND PAID ABSENCES

Treatment of Other Fringe Benefits

This organization charges the actual cost of each fringe benefit direct to
Federal projects.  However, it budgets fringe benefits on project proposals
by using a composite rate.  Following is the list of fringe benefits at the
University:

	Worker's Compensation			Disability Insurance
	Health Plan Contribution 		Life Insurance	
	Retirement System Contribution  	Unemployment Insurance
	FICA                            	Dental Plan Contribution

Treatment of Paid Absences
	
Vacation, holiday, sick leave pay and other paid absences are included in
salaries and wages and are charged to Federal projects as part of the normal
charge for salaries and wages. Separate charges for the cost of these
absences are not made.

SECTION III:	GENERAL

A.	LIMITATIONS:  The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory
or administrative limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other
agreement only to the extent that funds are available.  Acceptance of the
rates is subject to the following conditions:  (1) Only costs incurred by the
institution were included in its indirect cost pool as finally accepted; such
costs are legal obligations of the institution and are allowable under the
governing cost principles; (2) The same costs that have been treated as
indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar types of costs
have been accorded consistent accounting treatment, and (4) The information
provided by the institution which was used to establish the rates is not
later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.	ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  If a fixed or predetermined rate is in this Agree-
ment, it is based on the accounting system purported by the institution to be
in effect during the Agreement period.  Changes to the method of accounting
for costs which affect the amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of
this Agreement require the prior approval of the authorized representative of
the cognizant agency.  Such changes include, but are not limited to, changes
in the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct.
Failure to obtain approval may result in cost disallowances.

C.	FIXED RATES:  If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an
estimate of the costs for the period covered by the rate.  When the actual
costs for this period are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate of
a future year(s) to compensate for the difference between the costs used to
establish the fixed rate and actual costs.

D.	USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates in this Agreement were
approved in accordance with the authority in Office of Management and Budget
Circular A-88, and should be applied to grants, contracts and other agreements
covered by Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21, subject to any limi-
tations in A above.  The institution may provide copies of the Agreement to
other Federal agencies to give them early notification of the Agreement.

E.   SPECIAL REMARKS:

    (1)  Definition of On-Campus, Off-Campus and Special Rates


         a.  Definition of Off-Campus Rate

             The off-campus rate is applicable to those projects conducted at
             facilities not owned or leased by the University. However, if the
             project is conducted in leased space and the lease costs are
             directly charged to the project, then the off-campus rate must be
             used.

             Projects conducted entirely on-campus or entirely off-campus:
             Projects conducted entirely on-campus or entirely off-campus will
             be applied the on-campus or off-campus rate respectively.

             Projects conducted partially off-campus and partially on-campus:
             If the project involves work at both on-campus and off-campus
             sites, either the on-campus or off-campus rate generally should be
             applied, consistent with where the majority of the work is to be
             performed. Salary cost is generally accepted as a measure of work 
             performed in terms of the total project.

       	 b.  Use of Both On-Campus and Off-Campus Rates

             The use of both on-campus and off-campus rates for a given project
             may be justified if both of the respective rates can clearly be
             identified with a significant portion of salaries and wages of the                                 
             project.  For purposes of this provision, significant is defined
             as approximately 25% or more of the total costs and a project's
             total salary and wage costs exceed $250,000.

          c. Other Special Rates

             These rates apply only to the facility or program to which they
             are identified. If any additional special rates become necessary
             the establishment of such rates should be coordinated through the                
             cognizant negotiation agency.
