(A)	Nimitz Marine Facility
(B)	General Clinical Research Center, University Hospital

*BASE: Modified total direct costs, consisting of all salaries and wages,
fringe benefits, materials and supplies, services, travel, and subgrants and
subcontracts up to the first $25,000 of each subgrant or subcontract 
(regardless of the period covered by the subgrant or subcontract). 
Equipment, capital expenditures, charges for patient care and tuition 
remission, rental costs, scholarships, and fellowships as well as the portion 
of each subgrant and subcontract in excess of $25,000 shall be excluded from 
modified total direct costs.

SPECIAL REMARKS
The rates in this agreement have been negotiated or revised, as appropriate, 
to reflect the administrative cap provisions of the revision to 0MB Circular 
A-21 published by the Office of Management and Budget on July 26, 1993. No 
rate affecting the institution's fiscal periods beginning on or after October 
1, 1991 contains total administrative cost components in excess of that 26 
percent cap. However, in accordance with Section 481 of the National Defense 
Authorization act for Fiscal year 1994 (Public Law 103-160), the 
administrative cap does not apply to Department of Defense (DOD) contracts.

SECTION II :	TREATMENT OF FRINGE BENEFITS AND PAID ABSENCES

Treatment of Other Fringe Benefits

This organization charges the actual cost of each fringe benefit direct to 
Federal projects.  However, it budgets fringe benefits on project proposals by 
using a composite rate.  Following is the list of fringe benefits at the
University:

	Worker's Compensation			Disability Insurance
	Health Plan Contribution		Life Insurance
	Retirement System Contribution		Unemployment Insurance
	FICA					Dental Plan Contribution

Treatment of Paid Absences

Holiday, sick leave pay and other paid absences (excluding vacation benefits) 
are included in salaries and wages and are charged to Federal projects as part 
of the normal charge for salaries and wages.  Separate charges for the cost of 
these absences are not made.  A separate charge is made to Federal projects 
for vacation benefit leave accruals.

SECTION III:	GENERAL

A.    LIMITATIONS:  The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory or 
administrative limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other 
agreement only to the extent that funds are available.  Acceptance of the 
rates is subject to the following conditions: (1) Only costs incurred by the 
institution were included in its indirect cost pool as finally accepted; such 
costs are legal obligations of the institution and are allowable under the 
governing cost principles; (2) The same costs that have been treated as 
indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar types of costs 
have been accorded consistent accounting treatment, and (4) The information 
provided by the institution which was used to establish the rates is not later 
found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.	ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  If a fixed or predetermined rate is in this 
Agreement, it is based on the accounting system purported by the institution 
to be in effect during the Agreement period.  Changes to the method of 
accounting for costs which affect the amount of reinbursement resulting from 
the use of this Agreement require the prior approval of the authorized 
representative of the cognizant agency.  Such changes include, but are not 
limited to, changes in the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect 
to direct.  Failure to obtain approval may result in cost disallowances.

C.	FIXED RATES:  If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an 
estimate of the costs for the period covered by the rate.  When the actual 
costs for this period are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate of 
a future year(s) to compensate for the difference between the costs used to 
establish the fixed rate and actual costs.

D.     USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates in this Agreement were approved 
in accordance with the authority in Office of Management and Budget Circular 
A-88, and should be applied to grants, contracts and other agreements covered 
by Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21, subject to any limitations 
in A above.  The institution may provide copies of the Agreement to other 
Federal agencies to give them early notification of the Agreement.

E.	SPECIAL REMARKS:

(1)	Definition of On-Campus, Off-Campus and Special Rates
	a.  Definition of Off-Campus Rate
	    The off-campus rate is applicable to those projects conducted at 			    facilities not owned or leased by the University.  However, if the                           	    project is conducted in leased space and the lease costs are 
	    facilities not owned or leased by the University.  However, if 
	    the project is conducted in leased space and the lease costs are
	    directly charged to the project, then the off-campus rate must 
	    be used.

	    Projects conducted entirely on-campus or entirely off-campus:
	    Projects conducted entirely on-campus or entirely off-campus 
	    will be applied the on-campus or off-campus rate respectively.

	    Projects conducted partially off-campus and partially on-campus:
	    If the project involves work at both on-campus and off-campus 
	    sites, either the on-campus or off-campus rate generally should 
	    be applied, consistent with where the majority of the work is to 
	    be performed.  Salary cost is generally accepted as a measure of 
	    work performed in terms of the total project.

        b.  Use of Both On-Campus and Off-Campus Rates
	    The use of both on-campus and off-campus rates for a given 
	    project may be justified if both of the respective rates can 
	    clearly be identified with a significant portion of salaries and 
	    wages of the project. For purposes of this provision, 
	    significant is defined as approximately 25% or more of the total 
	    costs and a project's total salary and wage costs exceed 
	    $250,000.

	c.  Other Special Rates
	    These rates apply only to the facility or program to which they 
	    are identified.  If any additional special rates become 
	    necessary the establishment of such rates should be coordinated 
	    through the cognizant negotiation agency.

(2)	Definition of Equipment
	Equipment is defined as tangible non-expendable personal property 
	having a useful life of more than two year and an acquisition cost of 
	$500 or more.
