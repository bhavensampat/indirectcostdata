   AGREEMENT DATE: September 15, 1998

   TREATMENT OF FRINGE BENEFITS:                               
   This organization charges the actual cost of each fringe benefit direct to 
   Federal projects.  However, it uses a fringe benefit rate which is applied 
   to salaries and wages in budgeting fringe benefit costs under project      
   proposals.  The fringe benefits listed below are treated as direct costs.  

   TREATMENT OF PAID ABSENCES                                                 
   Holiday, sick leave pay and other paid absences (excluding vacation        
   benefits) are included in salaries and wages and are charged to Federal    
   projects as part of the normal charge for salaries and wages.  Separate    
   charges for the cost of these absences are not made.  A separate charge is 
   made to Federal projects for vacation benefit leave accruals.              
                                                                              
   DEFINITION OF EQUIPMENT                                                    
   Equipment is defined as tangible nonexpendable personal property having a  
   useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $500 or more  
   per unit.                                                                  
                                                                              
   DEFINITION OF ON-CAMPUS, OFF-CAMPUS AND SPECIAL RATES                      
                                                                              
   DEFINITION OF OFF-CAMPUS RATE                                              
   The off-campus rate is applicable to those projects conducted at facilities
   not owned or leased by the University.  However, if the project is         
   conducted in leased space and lease costs are directly charged to the      
   project, then the off-campus rate must be used.                            
                                                                              
   PROJECTS CONDUCTED ENTIRELY ON-CAMPUS OR ENTIRELY OFF-CAMPUS:              
   Projects conducted entirely on-campus or entirely off-campus will be       
   applied the on-campus or off-campus rate respectively.                     
                                                                              
   PROJECTS CONDUCTED PARTIALLY OFF-CAMPUS AND PARTIALLY ON-CAMPUS:           
   If the project involves work at both on-campus and off-campus sites, either
   the on-campus or off-campus rate generally should be applied, consistent   
   with where the majority of the work is to be performed.  Salary cost is    
   generally accepted as a measure of work performed in terms of the total    
   project.                                                                   
                                                                              
   USE OF BOTH ON-CAMPUS AND OFF-CAMPUS RATES                                 
   The use of both on-campus and off-campus rates for a given project may be  
   justified if both of the respective rates can clearly be identified with a 
   significant portion of salaries and wages of the project.  For purposes of 
   this provision, significant is defined as approximately 25% or more of the 
   total costs and a project's total salary and wage costs exceed $250,000.   
                                                                              
   OTHER SPECIAL RATES                                                        
   These rates apply only to the facility or program to which they are        
   identified.  If any additional special rates become necessary the          
   establishment of such rates should be coordinated through the cognizant    
   negotiation agency.                                                        
                                                                              
   The following fringe benefits are treated as direct costs:                 
   FICA, WORKERS COMPENSATION, HEALTH PLAN CONTRIBUTION, RETIREMENT SYSTEM    
   CONTRIBUTION, DISABILITY INSURANCE, LIFE INSURANCE, UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE,
   AND DENTAL PLAN CONTRIBUTION.

  AGREEMENT DATE: September 15, 1998
                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                        SECTION III:  GENERAL

   A.  LIMITATIONS:                  
   The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory or administrative 
   limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other agreement only to
   the extent that funds are available. Acceptance of the rates is subject to 
   the following conditions:                                                  
   (1) Only costs incurred by the organization were included in its facilities
   and administrative cost pools as finally accepted: such costs are legal    
   obligations of the organization and are allowable under the governing cost 
   principles; (2) The same costs that have been treated as facilities and    
   administrative costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar types of 
   costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) The      
   information provided by the organization which was used to establish the   
   rates is not later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate by the  
   Federal Government. In such situations the rate(s) would be subject to     
   renegotiation at the discretion of the Federal Government.                 
                                                                              

   B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:                         
   This Agreement is based on the accounting system purported by the          
   organization to be in effect during the Agreement period. Changes          
   to the method of accounting for costs which affect the amount of           
   reimbursement resulting from the use of this Agreement require             
   prior approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant agency.   
   Such changes include, but are not limited to, changes in                   
   the charging of a particular type of cost from facilities and              
   administrative to direct. Failure to obtain approval may result in cost    
   disallowances.                                                             
                                                                              

   C.  FIXED RATES:                  
   If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an estimate of the    
   costs for the period covered by the rate. When the actual                  
   costs for this period are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate 
   of a future year(s) to compensate for the difference                       
   between the costs used to establish the fixed rate and actual costs.       

   D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:                                    
   The rates in this Agreement were approved in accordance with the authority 
   in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21 Circular, and should be   
   applied to grants, contracts and other agreements covered by this Circular,
   subject to any limitations in A above. The organization may provide copies 
   of the Agreement to other Federal Agencies to give them early notification 
   of the Agreement.
