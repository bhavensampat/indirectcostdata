   TREATMENT OF PAID ABSENCES:                             
   Vacation, holiday, sick leave pay and other paid absences are included in  
   salaries and wages and are claimed on grants, contracts and other          
   agreements as part of the normal cost for salaries and wages.  Separate    
   claims for the costs of these paid absences are not made.                  

   The cost of vacation and personal days off are included in the Information 
   Sciences Institute fringe benefit rate.  Federal projects must be credited 
   for salaries and wages for periods when employees are on vacation or       
   personal days off.  Holiday, sick leave pay, and other paid absences are   
   included in salaries and wages and are charged to Federal projects as part 
   of the normal charge for salaries and wages.                               
                                                                              
   TREATMENT OF OTHER FRINGE BENEFITS                                         
   This organization uses a fringe benefit rate which is applied to salaries  
   and wages for both budgeting and charging purposes for Federal projects.   
   The following fringe benefits are included in the fringe benefit rate:     
   SOCIAL SECURITY, RETIREMENT PLANS, HEALTH AND DENTAL, UNEMPLOYMENT, WORKERS
   COMPENSATION, SABBATICAL LEAVE, TUITION REMISSION, LIFE INSURANCE, AND     
   MISCELLANEOUS EMPLOYEES SERVICES                                           
   Beginning 07/01/99, the fringe benefit rate includes only employee tuition 
   remission.  A separate rate is also applied for the Information Sciences   
   Institute for vacation and personal days off.                              
                                                                              
   DEFINITION OF OFF-CAMPUS:  A project is considered off-campus if the       
   activity is conducted at locations other than in University owned or       
   operated facilities and indirect costs associated with physical plant and  
   library are not considered applicable to the project.                      
                                                                              
   DEFINITION OF EQUIPMENT                                                    
   Effective 07/01/96, equipment is defined as tangible nonexpendable personal
   property having a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost
   of $5,000 or more per unit.                                                
                                                                              
   The rates in this agreement have been negotiated to reflect the            
   administrative cap provisions of the revision to OMB Circular A-21         
   published by the Office of Management and Budget on July 26, 1993.  No rate
   affecting the institution's fiscal periods beginning on or after October 1,
   1991 contains total administrative cost components in excess of that 26    
   percent cap.                                                               
                                                                              
   The rates relating to the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) is effective
   for the periods identified in the negotiation agreement provided that the  
   ISI funding or costing mechanisms now in place remain unchanged.

  AGREEMENT DATE: February 22, 1999
                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                        SECTION III:  GENERAL

   A.  LIMITATIONS:                  
   The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory or administrative 
   limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other agreement only to
   the extent that funds are available. Acceptance of the rates is subject to 
   the following conditions:                                                  
   (1) Only costs incurred by the organization were included in its facilities
   and administrative cost pools as finally accepted: such costs are legal    
   obligations of the organization and are allowable under the governing cost 
   principles; (2) The same costs that have been treated as facilities and    
   administrative costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar types of 
   costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) The      
   information provided by the organization which was used to establish the   
   rates is not later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate by the  
   Federal Government. In such situations the rate(s) would be subject to     
   renegotiation at the discretion of the Federal Government.                 
                                                                              

   B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:                         
   This Agreement is based on the accounting system purported by the          
   organization to be in effect during the Agreement period. Changes          
   to the method of accounting for costs which affect the amount of           
   reimbursement resulting from the use of this Agreement require             
   prior approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant agency.   
   Such changes include, but are not limited to, changes in                   
   the charging of a particular type of cost from facilities and              
   administrative to direct. Failure to obtain approval may result in cost    
   disallowances.                                                             
                                                                              

   C.  FIXED RATES:                  
   If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an estimate of the    
   costs for the period covered by the rate. When the actual                  
   costs for this period are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate 
   of a future year(s) to compensate for the difference                       
   between the costs used to establish the fixed rate and actual costs.       

   D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:                                    
   The rates in this Agreement were approved in accordance with the authority 
   in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21 Circular, and should be   
   applied to grants, contracts and other agreements covered by this Circular,
   subject to any limitations in A above. The organization may provide copies 
   of the Agreement to other Federal Agencies to give them early notification 
   of the Agreement.
