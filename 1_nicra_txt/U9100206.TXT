   TREATMENT OF PAID ABSENCES                                                 
   Except for LASP employees (Professional Researcher Employee Classification 
   only), vacation, holiday, sick leave pay and other paid absences are       
   included in salaries and wages and are charged to Federal projects as part 
   of the normal charge for salaries and wages.  Separate charges for the cost
   of these absences are not made.                                            
                                                                              
   For LASP (Professional Researcher Employee Classification only), the cost  
   of vacation, holiday, sick leave pay, and other paid absences are included 
   in a leave benefit rate which is applied to salaries and wages for         
   budgeting and charging purposes for Federal projects, and are not included 
   in direct charges for salaries and wages.  Charges for salaries and wages  
   must exclude those paid to LASP (Professional Researcher Employee          
   Classification only) for periods when they are on vacation, holiday, or    
   sick leave, or are otherwise absent from work.                             
                                                                              
   TREATMENT OF FRINGE BENEFITS                                               
   This organization uses a fringe benefit rate which is applied to salaries  
   and wages for both budgeting and charging purposes for Federal projects.   
   The following fringe benefits are included in the fringe benefit rate(s):  
   FICA, WORKERS COMPENSATION, HEALTH/LIFE/DENTAL/DISABILITY INS., ANNUITANT'S
   INS., UNEMPLOYMENT INS., TUITION WAIVERS, RETIREMENT PLANS, AND TERMINATION
   PAY.                                                                       
                                                                              
   DEFINITION OF EQUIPMENT                                                    
   Equipment is defined as tangible nonexpendable personal property having a  
   useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more
   per unit.                                                                  
                                                                              
   DEFINITION OF OFF-CAMPUS                                                   
   Off-campus activity shall be defined as those activities which, because of 
   location where work is performed, do not incur physical plant operations   
   and maintenance costs.                                                     
                                                                              
   Projects partially performed off-site are apportioned between their on-site
   components.  If 50% or more of the indirect cost rate base costs of the    
   project are determined to be on-site, the entire project is considered     
   on-site.  If less than 50% of the indirect cost rate base costs are        
   determined to be on-site, the entire project is considered off-site.       
                                                                              
   This rate agreement updates the fringe benefits only.

   A.  LIMITATIONS:                  
   The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory or administrative 
   limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other agreement only to
   the extent that funds are available. Acceptance of the rates is subject to 
   the following conditions:                                                  
   (1) Only costs incurred by the organization were included in its facilities
   and administrative cost pools as finally accepted: such costs are legal    
   obligations of the organization and are allowable under the governing cost 
   principles; (2) The same costs that have been treated as facilities and    
   administrative costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar types of 
   costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) The      
   information provided by the organization which was used to establish the   
   rates is not later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate by the  
   Federal Government. In such situations the rate(s) would be subject to     
   renegotiation at the discretion of the Federal Government.                 
                                                                              

   B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:                         
   This Agreement is based on the accounting system purported by the          
   organization to be in effect during the Agreement period. Changes          
   to the method of accounting for costs which affect the amount of           
   reimbursement resulting from the use of this Agreement require             
   prior approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant agency.   
   Such changes include, but are not limited to, changes in                   
   the charging of a particular type of cost from facilities and              
   administrative to direct. Failure to obtain approval may result in cost    
   disallowances.                                                             
                                                                              

   C.  FIXED RATES:                  
   If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an estimate of the    
   costs for the period covered by the rate. When the actual                  
   costs for this period are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate 
   of a future year(s) to compensate for the difference                       
   between the costs used to establish the fixed rate and actual costs.       

   D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:                                    
   The rates in this Agreement were approved in accordance with the authority 
   in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21 Circular, and should be   
   applied to grants, contracts and other agreements covered by this Circular,
   subject to any limitations in A above. The organization may provide copies 
   of the Agreement to other Federal Agencies to give them early notification 
   of the Agreement.
