   AGREEMENT DATE: August 16, 1999
                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                   SECTION II:  SPECIAL REMARKS

   TREATMENT OF PAID ABSENCES                                                 
   Except for LASP employees, vacation, holiday, sick leave pay and other paid
   absences are included in salaries and wages and are charged to Federal     
   projects as part of the normal charge for salaries and wages.  Separate    
   charges for the cost of these absences are not made.                       
                                                                              
   For LASP (Professional Researcher Employee Classification), the cost of    
   vacation, holiday, sick leave pay, and other paid absences (and associated 
   other fringe benefits) are included in a fringe benefit rate and are not   
   included in direct charges for salaries and wages.  Charges for salaries   
   and wages must exclude those paid to LASP (Professional Researcher Employee
   Classification) for periods when they are on vacation, holiday, or sick    
   leave, or are otherwise absent from work.                                  
                                                                              
   TREATMENT OF FRINGE BENEFITS                                               
   Except for LASP employees, this organization charges the actual cost of    
   each fringe benefit direct to Federal projects.  However, it uses a fringe 
   benefit rate which is applied to salaries and wages in budgeting fringe    
   benefit costs under project proposals.  The following fringe benefits are  
   treated as direct costs:                                                   
   FICA, WORKERS COMPENSATION, HEALTH/LIFE/DISABILITY ANNUITANT'S UNEMPLOYMENT
   INSURANCE, AND RETIREMENT PLANS.                                           
                                                                              
   For LASP employees, this organization uses a fringe benefit rate which is  
   applied to salaries and wages for budgeting and charging purposes for      
   Federal projects.  The following fringe benefits are included in LASP      
   fringe benefit rate:                                                       
   PAID ABSENCES, (Professional Research Employee Classification only), FICA, 
   MEDICARE, HEALTH/LIFE/DISABILITY INSURANCE, AND RETIREMENT.                
                                                                              
   DEFINITION OF EQUIPMENT                                                    
   Equipment is defined as tangible nonexpendable personal property having a  
   useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more
   per unit.                                                                  
                                                                              
   DEFINITION OF OFF-CAMPUS                                                   
   Off-campus activity shall be defined as those activities which, because of 
   location where work is performed, do not incur physical plant operations   
   and maintenance costs.                                                     
                                                                              
   Projects partially performed off-site are apportioned between their on-site
   components.  If 50% or more of the indirect cost rate base costs of the    
   project are determined to be on-site, the entire project is considered     
   on-site.  If less than 50% of the indirect cost rate base costs re         
   determined to be on-site, the entire project is considered off-site.

  AGREEMENT DATE: August 16, 1999
                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                        SECTION III:  GENERAL

   A.  LIMITATIONS:                  
   The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory or administrative 
   limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other agreement only to
   the extent that funds are available. Acceptance of the rates is subject to 
   the following conditions:                                                  
   (1) Only costs incurred by the organization were included in its facilities
   and administrative cost pools as finally accepted: such costs are legal    
   obligations of the organization and are allowable under the governing cost 
   principles; (2) The same costs that have been treated as facilities and    
   administrative costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar types of 
   costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) The      
   information provided by the organization which was used to establish the   
   rates is not later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate by the  
   Federal Government. In such situations the rate(s) would be subject to     
   renegotiation at the discretion of the Federal Government.                 
                                                                              

   B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:                         
   This Agreement is based on the accounting system purported by the          
   organization to be in effect during the Agreement period. Changes          
   to the method of accounting for costs which affect the amount of           
   reimbursement resulting from the use of this Agreement require             
   prior approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant agency.   
   Such changes include, but are not limited to, changes in                   
   the charging of a particular type of cost from facilities and              
   administrative to direct. Failure to obtain approval may result in cost    
   disallowances.                                                             
                                                                              

   C.  FIXED RATES:                  
   If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an estimate of the    
   costs for the period covered by the rate. When the actual                  
   costs for this period are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate 
   of a future year(s) to compensate for the difference                       
   between the costs used to establish the fixed rate and actual costs.       

   D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:                                    
   The rates in this Agreement were approved in accordance with the authority 
   in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21 Circular, and should be   
   applied to grants, contracts and other agreements covered by this Circular,
   subject to any limitations in A above. The organization may provide copies 
   of the Agreement to other Federal Agencies to give them early notification 
   of the Agreement.
