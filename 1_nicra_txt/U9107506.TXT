   TREATMENT OF FRINGE BENEFITS:                               
   This organization charges the actual cost of each fringe benefit direct to 
   Federal projects.  However, it uses a fringe benefit rate which is applied 
   to salaries and wages in budgeting fringe benefit costs under project      
   proposals.  The fringe benefits listed below are treated as direct costs.  

   The following fringe benefits are treated as direct costs:                 
   SOCIAL SECURITY, HEALTH/LIFE INSURANCE, WORKERS COMPENSATION, UNEMPLOYMENT 
   INSURANCE, RETIREMENT (STATE, TFFR, OR TIAA/CREF), DISABILITY INSURANCE,   
   AND EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM                                            
                                                                              
   TREATMENT OF PAID ABSENCES                                                 
   Except for EERC Employees, vacation, holiday, sick leave pay and other paid
   absence are inlcuded in salaries and wages and are charged to federal      
   projects as part of the normal charge for salaries and wages.  Separate    
   charges for the cost of these absences are not made.                       
                                                                              
   For EERC employees, the cost of vacation, holiday, sick leave pay, and     
   other paid absences (and associated other fringe benefits) are included in 
   a fringe benefit rate and are not included in direct charges for salaries  
   and wages.  Charges for salaries and wages must exclude those paid to EERC 
   employees for periods when they are on vacation, holiday, or sick leave, or
   are otherwise absent from work.                                            
                                                                              
   DEFINITION OF EQUIPMENT                                                    
   Equipment is defined as tangible nonexpendable personal property having a  
   useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more
   per unit.                                                                  
                                                                              
   DEFINITION OF OFF-CAMPUS                                                   
   An off-campus activity is defined as that activity performed by University 
   employees at locations other than the main campus and not using the        
   University's operation and maintenance facilities.                         
                                                                              
   Activity such as short term (less than one month's duration) travel by     
   employees to an off-campus site where office space is maintained on campus 
   in their absence shall be considered on campus activity for the purposes of
   applying the indirect cost rates.  Travel in excess of one month's duration
   will be reviewed and classified on or off campus on a case by case basis.  
                                                                              
   Activity performed by other than University employees through contractual  
   arrangements is normally considered on campus with only the first $25,000  
   subject to the on campus indirect cost rate.

  AGREEMENT DATE: June 27, 2006
                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                        SECTION III:  GENERAL

   A.  LIMITATIONS:                  
   The rates in this Agreement are subject to any statutory or administrative 
   limitations and apply to a given grant, contract or other agreement only to
   the extent that funds are available. Acceptance of the rates is subject to 
   the following conditions:                                                  
   (1) Only costs incurred by the organization were included in its facilities
   and administrative cost pools as finally accepted: such costs are legal    
   obligations of the organization and are allowable under the governing cost 
   principles; (2) The same costs that have been treated as facilities and    
   administrative costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) Similar types of 
   costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) The      
   information provided by the organization which was used to establish the   
   rates is not later found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate by the  
   Federal Government. In such situations the rate(s) would be subject to     
   renegotiation at the discretion of the Federal Government.                 
                                                                              

   B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:                         
   This Agreement is based on the accounting system purported by the          
   organization to be in effect during the Agreement period. Changes          
   to the method of accounting for costs which affect the amount of           
   reimbursement resulting from the use of this Agreement require             
   prior approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant agency.   
   Such changes include, but are not limited to, changes in                   
   the charging of a particular type of cost from facilities and              
   administrative to direct. Failure to obtain approval may result in cost    
   disallowances.                                                             
                                                                              

   C.  FIXED RATES:                  
   If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an estimate of the    
   costs for the period covered by the rate. When the actual                  
   costs for this period are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate 
   of a future year(s) to compensate for the difference                       
   between the costs used to establish the fixed rate and actual costs.       

   D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:                                    
   The rates in this Agreement were approved in accordance with the authority 
   in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21 Circular, and should be   
   applied to grants, contracts and other agreements covered by this Circular,
   subject to any limitations in A above. The organization may provide copies 
   of the Agreement to other Federal Agencies to give them early notification 
   of the Agreement.
