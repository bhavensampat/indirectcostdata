SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                                                                  

A.  LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I of this agreement is expressly
subject to any statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable to a given grant, contract,
or other agreement only to the extent that funds are available and consistent with any and all
limitations of cost clauses or provisions, if any, contained therein.  Acceptance of any or all of
the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon all the following conditions: (1) that no costs other
than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in its indirect cost pool as finally
accepted and that all such costs are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable
under the governing and applicable cost principles; (2) that the same costs that have been treated
as indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs have been accorded
consistent accounting treatment; and (4) that the information provided by the contractor/grantee,
which was used as the basis for the acceptance of the rate(s) agreed to herein and expressly relied
upon by the Government in negotiating and accepting the said rates, is not subsequently found to
be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The predetermined indirect cost and fringe benefits rates
contained in Section I of this agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at the time
this agreement was negotiated.  Changes to the method of accounting for costs which affects the
amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates requires the express and written
approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant negotiating agency for the Government
prior to implementation of any such changes.  Such changes include but are not limited to
changes in the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure on the part of
the grantee/contractor to obtain the required approval may result in subsequent cost
disallowances.

C.  PREDETERMINED RATES: The predetermined indirect cost and fringe benefits rates
contained in this agreement are not subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of
OMB Circular A-21, subject to the limitations contained in Part A of this section.

D.  CARRY-FORWARD AMOUNTS: The predetermined and fringe benefits rates set forth in
Section I of this agreement are inclusive of estimated carry-forward amounts from FY 1993 and
FY 1994 as follows:

     1.  The FY 1993 carry-forward amounts are estimated amounts.  When Syracuse

negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB Circular A-88. Accord-
ingly, such rates shall be applied, to the extent provided in such circular, to grants and contracts
to which OMB Circular A-21 is applicable, subject to any limitations in part A of this section.

D.  SPECIAL REMARKS:

     1. Effective 1 July 1995, Syracuse University agrees to maintain records which support
billed and incurred fringe benefits costs for each fringe benefits pool.

     2.  Signature of this agreement by the authorized representatives of Syracuse University
and the Government, acknowledges and affirms the university's request for waiver of the
prohibition contained in DFARS 231.303(1) and the Government's exercise of its discretion
under DFARS 231.303(2) to waive the prohibition in DFARS 231.303(1).  The waiver request by
Syracuse University is made to simplify the university's overall management of DOD cost
reimbursements under DOD contracts.
