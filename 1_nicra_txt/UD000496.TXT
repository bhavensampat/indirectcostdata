A.   LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is subject to any statutory or
administrative limitations, and is applicable to a given grant, contract or other agreement only to
the extent that funds are available and consistent with any and all limitations of cost clauses or
provisions, if any, contained therein.  Acceptance of the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon
all the following conditions: (1) that no costs other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor
were included in the indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that all such costs are legal
obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under governing  cost principles; (2) that the
same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar
types of costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) that the information
provided by the contractor/grantee, which was used as the basis for the acceptance of the rates
agreed to herein and expressly relied upon by the Government in negotiating and accepting the
said rates is not subsequently found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.   ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The rates contained in Section I of this agreement are
based on the accounting system in effect at the time this agreement was negotiated. Changes to
the method(s) of accounting for costs which affects the amount of reimbursement resulting from
the use of these rates require the written approval of the authorized representative of the
cognizant negotiating agency for the Government prior to implementation of any such changes. 
Such changes include but are not limited to changes in the charging of a particular type of cost
from indirect to direct.  Failure to obtain such approval may result in subsequent cost
disallowances.

C.   PREDETERMINED RATES: This type of rate is considered final and not subject to
adjustment in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21 and the Federal Acquisition
Regulation, subject to the limitations contained in Part A of this section.

D.   CARRY-FORWARD AMOUNTS:

     1.   The rates set forth in Section I of this agreement are inclusive of estimated carry-forward adjustments from FY 1995.  After negotiation and finalization of FY 1995 actual costs,
any differences between the FY 1995 estimated carry-forward amounts shown on the rate
component sheets for FY 1996 - 1997 and the actual carry-forward amounts shall be included as
an adjustment to the next subsequent rate negotiation.   

     2.   The FY 1994 actual carry-forward amounts, as established by the Negotiation
Agreement, FY 1994 Actual Rates and Carry-Forward Amounts, are liquidated herein in their
entirety.  Accordingly, the rates set forth in Section I of this agreement are inlcusive of and
represents full and complete liquidation of the actual carry-forward amounts resulting from the
establishment of FY 1994 actual costs.  No future claim for carry-forward amounts applicable to
FY 1994 shall be submitted.  

E.   USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in Section I hereof were
negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB Circular A-88. 
Accordingly, such rates shall be applied to the extent provided in such circular to grants,
contracts and other agreements to which OMB Circular A-21 is applicable, subject to any
limitations in part A of this section. Copies of this document may be provided by either party to
other Federal agencies which have or intend to issue or award grants and contracts using these
rates or to otherwise provide such agencies with documentary notice of this agreement and its
terms and conditions.
