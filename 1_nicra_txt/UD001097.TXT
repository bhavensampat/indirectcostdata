SECTION II: GENERAL
_________________________________________________________________

A.  LIMITATIONS: Use of the rates contained in this Agreement is subject to any
statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable  to a given grant or contract only
to the extent that funds are available.   Acceptance of the rates agreed to herein is
predicated upon  the following conditions:  (1) that no costs other than those incurred by
the grantee/contractor were included in this indirect cost pool as finally accepted and
that such costs are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under
governing cost principles: (2) that the same costs that have been treated as indirect
costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs have been accorded
consistent accounting treatment; and (4) that the information provided by the
grantee/contractor which was used  as a basis for acceptance of the rates agreed to
herein is not subsequently found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The fixed rates contained in this Agreement are based
on the accounting system in effect at the time the agreement was negotiated.  Changes
to the method of accounting for costs which affect the amount of reimbursement
resulting from the use of these rates require the prior approval of the authorized
representative of the cognizant negotiation agency.  Such changes include, but are not
limited to changes in the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct. 
Failure to obtain such approval may result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C.  FIXED RATES:  Each fixed rate in this agreement, is based on an estimate of the
costs for the period covered by the rate.  When actual costs for this period are
determined, an adjustment may be made to a rate of a future year to recognize the
difference between the estimated costs used to establish the fixed rate and the
negotiated actual costs.

D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The fixed rates contained herein were
negotiated in accordance with the authority set forth in OMB Circular A-21, and should
be applied to grants and contracts to which OMB Circular A-21 applies,  subject to any
limitations in paragraph A. above.  Copies of this document may be provided by the
Institution to other Federal Agencies having grants and contracts using these rates as a
means of providing them with early notification of the agreement contained herein.

E.  APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DOD CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS

In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless waived by the institution) may
be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred by an
institution of higher education under a DoD contract awarded on or after 
November 30, 1993, unless the same limitation is applied uniformly to all other 
organizations performing similar work.  It has been determined by the Department of
Defense that such limitation is not being uniformly applied.  Accordingly, the rates cited
(1) of Section I, as explained under title "APPLICABLE TO" (1), do not reflect the 




application of the 26% limitation on administrative indirect costs imposed by OMB A-21,
whereas (2) does so.

F.   LIQUIDATION OF PRIOR YEAR CARRYFORWARD AMOUNTS

     1.   F&A Rates

          The F&A rates set forth herein include no consideration for the
          liquidation of any prior year's actual or estimated carryforward
          amounts.

     2.   Fringe Benefit Rates     

          Through 30 June 1995 the University had an accumulated fringe
          benefit overrecovery carryforward amount of $5,556,960.   The
          Fringe Benefit rate of 23.00% set forth herein includes the
          liquidation of $3,012,742 of the $5,556,960 overrecovery
          carryforward.  The remaining overrecovery carryforward balance of
          $2,544,218 will be liquidated through a future year's fringe benefit
          rate.


G.   QUALIFICATIONS; The parties have agreed to these fixed rates with the
      following understandings:

     1.  The fixed rates contained in this agreement are based, in part, on the
institution's 1995 cost allocation special study for utility cost.  The Government has not
accepted the methodology or results of this special study, but has agreed to partially
utilize the results of the study as a basis for negotiating the university's FY97 fixed F&A
rates.  Use of such methodology is on a non-precedent setting basis, and does not
imply Government acceptance of the results of the utility cost allocation special study in
this or any other indirect cost rate negotiation.

     2.  The purpose of this agreement is to establish fixed Fringe Benefit rates, and
fixed F&A rates for the period 1 July 1996 through 30 June 1997.  Rates established in
Section I above are based on Carnegie Mellon University's proposal dated 29 March
1996, and the establishment of these rates by the Government, based on the
accounting systems and allocation methodologies contained in this proposal, does not
represent an agreement that these systems and methodologies are accepted for FY97, 
or for any subsequent fiscal year's rate negotiation.  The recommendations of the
Defense Contract Audit Agency, Pittsburgh Branch in Audit Report No. 6381-
96C23000001 were considered during the negotiation of these rates.  

     3.   Carnegie Mellon's 29 March 1996 proposal for the SEI FY97 F&A rate
 included a 3.6% factor for Faculty Administration.  Carnegie Mellon and the
Government are currently in disagreement concerning inclusion of the 3.6% Faculty
Administration factor in the SEI F&A rate.  Therefore, for the sole purpose of 



negotiating the SEI FY97 F&A rate, the parties have agreed to exclude the 3.6%
Faculty Administration factor from the SEI rate.  This agreement is on a non-precedent
setting basis, and the University does not waive its right to a more favorable treatment
of the 3.6% Faculty Administration factor in the future, either for the negotiation of SEI's
forward pricing F&A rate, or for the negotiation of any SEI final F&A rate.

     4.   The Full Time Faculty and Staff fixed fringe benefit rate set forth herein
includes recognition of cost accruals for Postemployment Benefits and for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions.  The Government's recognition of these
cost accruals is predicated on the University's establishing an irrevocable trust
acceptable to the Government, such trust to be funded with all accrued costs related to
Postemployment Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions.  Pending
the University's establishment and funding of  the irrevocable trust, the Government's
recognition of these cost accruals for the purpose of setting the FY97 fringe benefit rate
is on a non-precedent setting basis, and does not imply Government recognition of
such accrual costs in any future forward pricing or final F&A cost rate negotiation.
