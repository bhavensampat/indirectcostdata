SECTION II - GENERAL                                                    
                                                                                                                                                             


A.   LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is subject to any statutory
or administrative limitations and is applicable to a given grant or contract only to the extent
that funds are available.  Acceptance of the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon all of
the following conditions: (1) that no costs other than those incurred by the
grantee/contractor were included in this indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that such
costs are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under governing cost
principles, (2) that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed
as direct costs, (3) that similar types of costs have been accorded consistent accounting
treatment, and (4) that the information provided by the grantee/contractor which was used
as a basis for acceptance of the rates agreed to herein, and expressly relied upon by the
Government in negotiating and accepting the said rates is not subsequently found to be
materially incomplete or inaccurate.          


B.   ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The rates contained in Section I of this agreement are
based on the accounting system in effect at the time the agreement was negotiated. 
Changes to the method(s) of accounting for costs which affect the amount of
reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates require the prior approval of the
authorized representative of the cognizant negotiation agency.  Such changes include but
are not limited to changes in the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct. 
Failure to obtain such approval may result in subsequent cost disallowances.


C.   USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in Section I were
negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB Circular A-21.
Accordingly, such rates shall be applied to the extent provided in such Circular to grants
and contracts to which OMB Circular A-21 applies, subject to any limitations in part A of this
section.  Copies of this document may be provided by either party to other federal agencies
which have or intend to issue or award sponsored agreements using these rates or to
otherwise provide such agencies with documentary notice of this agreement and its terms
and conditions.


D.   PREDETERMINED RATES:  The predetermined rates contained in this agreement
are not subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21,
subject to the limitations contained in Part A of this Section.




E.   LIQUIDATION OF PRIOR YEAR CARRYFORWARD AMOUNTS: 

     1.   The predetermined F&A rates set forth in this agreement contain no amounts for
            liquidation of carryforwards from any prior year.

     2.    The predetermined fringe benefit rate set forth in this agreement includes the
                  complete liquidation of an overrecovery amount of $2,121,000 from FY96.


F.   QUALIFICATIONS:

     1.  The predetermined rates contained in this agreement are based, in part, on the
institution's 1993 cost allocation special study for utility cost.  The Government has not
accepted the methodology or results of this special study, but has agreed to partially utilize
the results of the study as a basis for negotiating the university's FY98 predetermined F&A
rates.  Use of such methodology is on a non-precedent setting basis, and does not imply
Government acceptance of the results of the utility cost allocation special study in this or
any other indirect cost rate negotiation.

     2.  The purpose of this agreement is to establish a predetermined Fringe Benefit rate
for the period 1 July 1997 through 30 June 1998, and to establish predetermined F&A rates
for the period of 1 July 1997 through 30 June 2000.  Rates established in Section I above
are based on Columbia University's proposal dated 3 February 1997, and the establishment
of these rates by the Government, based on the accounting systems and allocation
methodologies contained in this proposal, does not represent an agreement that these
systems and methodologies are accepted for FY98, FY99, or FY2000, or for any
subsequent fiscal year's rate negotiation.  The recommendations of the Defense Contract
Audit Agency, New York City Branch in Audit Report No. 2211-97B23000277 were
considered during the negotiation of these rates.  

     3.   This Negotiation Agreement is based on Columbia University's 3 February 1997
request for waiver of the prohibition contained in DFARS 231.303 (1) and the Government's
exercise of its discretion under DFARS 231.303 (2) to waive the prohibition in DFARS
231.303 (1).  The waiver request by Columbia University is made to simplify the university's
overall management of DOD reimbursement under DOD contracts.     

     











     4.   Effective 1 July 1997, Columbia will increase its equipment capitalization
threshold from $500 to $2,000.  The predetermined rates contained in this agreement are
based on the $2,000 equipment capitalization threshold.
