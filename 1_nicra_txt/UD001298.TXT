The facilities & administrative rates, and fringe benefit rates contained herein are for
use on grants, contracts and/or other agreements issued or awarded to Cornell
University Medical College (CUMC) by all Federal Agencies of the United States of

A.   LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is subject to any statutory
or administrative limitations and is applicable to a given grant or contract only to the extent
that funds are available.  Acceptance of the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon all
of the following conditions: (1) that no costs other than those incurred by the
grantee/contractor were included in this indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that such
costs are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under governing cost
principles, (2) that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed
as direct costs, (3) that similar types of costs have been accorded consistent accounting
treatment, and (4) that the information provided by the grantee/contractor which was used
as a basis for acceptance of the rates agreed to herein, and expressly relied upon by the
Government in negotiating and accepting the said rates is not subsequently found to be
materially incomplete or inaccurate.          

B.   ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The rates contained in Section I of this agreement are
based on the accounting system in effect at the time the agreement was negotiated. 
Changes to the method(s) of accounting for costs which affect the amount of
reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates require the prior approval of the
authorized representative of the cognizant negotiation agency.  Such changes include but
are not limited to changes in the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct. 
Failure to obtain such approval may result in subsequent cost disallowances.





C.   USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in Section I were
negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB Circular A-21.
Accordingly, such rates shall be applied to the extent provided in such Circular to grants
and contracts to which OMB Circular A-21 applies, subject to any limitations in part A of
this section.  Copies of this document may be provided by either party to other federal
agencies which have or intend to issue or award sponsored agreements using these rates
or to otherwise provide such agencies with documentary notice of this agreement and its
terms and conditions.


D.   FIXED RATES WITH CARRYFORWARD PROVISIONS:   

     1.   This type of rate is considered final and not subject to adjustment in
accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21 and the Federal Acquisition
Regulation, subject to the limitations contained in Part A of this Section; except that the
difference between the estimated costs and the actual costs of the period covered by the
rate is carried forward as an adjustment to the rate computation of a subsequent period as
discussed below.

     2.   The FY 98/99/2000 fringe benefit rates contained in this agreement are
based on estimates of the costs for FY 98/99/2000.  When actual costs for each period
are determined, adjustments will be applied to the next subsequent rate negotiation to
compensate for the difference between the estimated FY 98/99/2000 costs used to
establish the fixed fringe benefit rates with carryforward provisions and the negotiated
actual FY 98/99/2000 costs.


E.   PREDETERMINED RATES:  The predetermined rates contained in this agreement
are not subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21,
subject to the limitations contained in Part A of this Section.

















F.   LIQUIDATION OF PRIOR YEAR CARRYFORWARD AMOUNTS: The following
tables set forth the liquidation of prior year carryforward amounts from FY 1994 and FY
1995 (all amounts in $000's):

The unliquidated carryforward balance shown above will be liquidated during a future fixed
or predetermined rate negotiation.  In the event that CUMC changes to the use of
postdetermined rates, the above unliquidated carryforward balance will be liquidated as
part of the next postdetermined rates negotiation.

G.   SPECIAL REMARKS:

     1.  The purpose of this agreement is to establish predetermined facilities and
administrative rates, and fixed fringe benefit rates for the period of 1 July 1997 through
 30 June 2000.  Rates established in Section I above are based on the institution's
proposal dated 24 December 1996, and DCAA audit report No. 2211-97B23000253 of 27
March 1997.

     2.  The off-campus rates are established for research and research training
performed for 90 days or more at the Westchester Division of New York Hospital located
in White Plains, NY and all other off-campus locales.



     3.  The provisions of DFARS 231.303 state that no limitation may be placed on the
reimbiursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred by a university under a DOD
contract awarded after November 30,1993.  The provisions of DFARS 231.303 have not
been applied to this predetermined rate agreement because CUMC has received no DOD
contract awards after November 30, 1993, and does not expect to receive any DOD
contracts during the period of this agreement.

     4.  The predetermined rates contained in this agreement are based on the
institution's cost allocation special study for weighted utilities (FY98), and an alternate
allocation base for the animal care center (FY's 98,99 and 2000).  Establishment of the
predetermined rates for FY98 through FY2000 does not constitute Government
acceptance of the special study or alternate allocation base for any other fiscal year.  The
Government's agreement to the predetermined rates for FY98 through FY2000 is non-precedent
setting, and does not imply Government acceptance of the results of the special
study or alternate allocation base in any other indirect cost rate negotiation.
