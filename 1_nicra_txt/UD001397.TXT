                          APPLICABLE TO

          (1)  Applies to all DoD contracts awarded before November 30, 1993, all
Non-DoD Instruments, and all DoD Grants.

          (2)  Applies only to DoD contracts awarded on or after November 30,
1993 in accordance with and under the authority of DFARS 231.303(1).  See Section II,
Part C, hereof.  




                                                                                                                                                             
       
SECTION II - GENERAL                                                    
                                                                                                                                                             

A.   LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is subject to any statutory
or administrative limitations and is applicable to a given grant or contract only to the extent
that funds are available.  Acceptance of the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon all
of the following conditions: (1) that no costs other than those incurred by the
grantee/contractor were included in this indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that such
costs are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under governing cost
principles, (2) that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed
as direct costs, (3) that similar types of costs have been accorded consistent accounting
treatment, and (4) that the information provided by the grantee/contractor which was used
as a basis for acceptance of the rates agreed to herein, and expressly relied upon by the
Government in negotiating and accepting the said rates is not subsequently found to be
materially incomplete or inaccurate.          

B.   ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The rates contained in Section I of this agreement are
based on the accounting system in effect at the time the agreement was negotiated. 
Changes to the method(s) of accounting for costs which affect the amount of
reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates require the prior approval of the
authorized representative of the cognizant negotiation agency.  Such changes include but
are not limited to changes in the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct. 
Failure to obtain such approval may result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C.   APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DoD
CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS:  In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation
(unless waived by the institution) may be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise
allowable indirect costs incurred by an institution of higher education under a DOD
contract awarded on or after November 30, 1993, unless the same limitation is applied
uniformly to all other organizations performing similar work.  It has been determined by the
Department of Defense that such limitation is not being uniformly applied.  Accordingly,
the rates cited (2) of Section I, as explained under the title "APPLICABLE TO" do not
reflect the application of the 26% limitation on administrative indirect costs imposed by
OMB Circular A-21 whereas (1) does so.

D.   USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in Section I were
negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB Circular A-21.
Accordingly, such rates shall be applied to the extent provided in such Circular to grants
and contracts to which OMB Circular A-21 applies, subject to any limitations in part A of
this section.  Copies of this document may be provided by either party to other federal
agencies which have or intend to issue or award sponsored agreements using these rates
or to otherwise provide such agencies with documentary notice of this agreement and its
terms and conditions.


E.   FIXED RATES WITH CARRYFORWARD PROVISIONS:   

     1.   This type of rate is considered final and not subject to adjustment in
accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21 and the Federal Acquisition
Regulation, subject to the limitations contained in Part A of this Section; except that the
difference between the estimated costs and the actual costs of the period covered by the
rate is carried forward as an adjustment to the rate computation of a subsequent period as
discussed below.

     2.   The FY 97 rates contained in this agreement are based on estimates of the
costs for FY 97.  When actual costs for this period are determined, adjustments will be
applied to the next subsequent rate negotiation to compensate for the difference between
the estimated FY 97 costs used to establish the fixed rates with carryforward provisions
and the negotiated actual FY 97 costs.

F.   PREDETERMINED RATES:  The predetermined rates contained in this agreement
are not subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21,
subject to the limitations contained in Part A of this Section.

G.   LIQUIDATION OF PRIOR YEAR CARRYFORWARD AMOUNTS: The following
tables set forth the cumulation and liquidation of prior year carryforward amounts from FY
1987 through FY 1996 (all amounts in $000's):

carryforward amounts through FY 95.  The FY 96 underrecovery amount of $681
liquidated herein is based on an estimate of the carryforward for FY 96.  The FY 96
estimated carryforward amount liquidated herein will be credited against the final total
carryforward amount for FY 96 when computing the remaining unliquidated carryforward
balance for FY 96.

FY 93, FY 95 and FY 96, leaving an unliquidated overrecovery balance of $1,040 from FY
87 - FY 94.  The unliquidated overrecovery balance of $1,040 was applied against the 
FY 95 final underrecovery carryforward amount of $1,717, thus completing the liquidation
of all FY 87 - FY 94 carryforward amounts, and leaving a FY 95 unliquidated
underrecovery balance of $677. The FY 97 fixed rate incorporates the liquidation of $478   
of FY 95's final underrecovery carryforward amount, and the FY 98 provisional rate
incorporates the liquidation of the remaining $199 of FY 95's final underrecovery
carryforward amount,  thus completing the liquidation of the total final FY 95 carryforward.

The FY 97 "Full Fringe Benefit" rate set forth above includes the complete liquidation of
the final $591 underrecovery amount from FY 95.  The FY 97 "Partial Fringe Benefit" rate
set forth above includes the complete liquidation of the final $.84 underrecovery amount

H.   SPECIAL REMARKS: The purpose of this agreement is to establish fixed F&A
rates with carryforward provisions, and predetermined rates for the period 1 July 1996
through 30 June 1997; and to establish provisional F&A rates for the period 1 July 1997
through 30 June 1998.  These rates are based on GIT/GTRC's proposal dated 20 June
1996 and the establishment of these rates by the Government based on the accounting
systems and allocation methodologies contained in this proposal does not represent an
agreement that these systems and methodologies are accepted for fiscal years 1997 or
1998, or for any subsequent year's rate negotiation.  The recommendations of the
Defense Contract Audit Agency, Atlanta Branch in Audit Report # 1101-96T23000008
were considered in the negotiation of these rates.
