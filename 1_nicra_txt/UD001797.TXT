SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS



A.   LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is 
subject to any statutory or administrative limitations and is 
applicable to a given grant, contract or other agreement only to
the extent that funds are available and consistent with any and 
all limitations of cost clauses or provisions, if any, contained 
therein.  Acceptance of the rates agreed to herein is predicated 
upon all of the following conditions: (1) that no costs other 
than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in 
this indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that such costs
are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable 
under governing cost principles; (2) that the same costs that 
have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct 
costs; (3) that similar types of costs have been accorded 
consistent accounting treatment; and (4) that the
information provided by the grantee/contractor, which was 
used as the basis for acceptance of the rates agreed to herein 
and expressly relied upon by the Government in negotiating and 
accepting the said rates, is not subsequently found to be 
materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.   ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The rates contained in Section I of 
this agreement are based on the accounting system in effect 
at the time the agreement was negotiated.  Changes to the 
method(s) of accounting for costs which affect the amount 
of reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates 
require the written approval of the authorized representative 
of the cognizant negotiating agency for the Government prior 
to implementation of any such changes.  Such changes include 
but are not limited to changes in the charging of a 
particular type of costs from indirect to direct.  Failure 
to obtain such approval may result in subsequent cost
disallowances.

C.   FIXED RATES: The fixed rates contained in this agreement 
are based on estimates of the costs for FY 1997.  When actual 
costs for FY 1997 are determined, adjustments will be applied 
to the next subsequent rate negotiation to compensate for the 
difference between the FY 1997 estimated costs used to 
establish the fixed rates and the negotiated actual FY 1997 costs.

     1.   The rates set forth in this agreement are inclusive 
of carry-forward amounts.

actual carry-forward amounts resulting from the establishment of 
FY 1995 actual costs Negotiation Agreement dated (insert date).  
No future claim for carry-forward amounts applicable to FY 1995
shall be submitted.  The FY 1995 carry-forward amounts are 
liquidated as follows:
