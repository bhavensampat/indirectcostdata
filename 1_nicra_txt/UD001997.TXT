SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS



A.  LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I of this 
agreement is expressly subject to any statutory or administrative 
limitations and is applicable to a given grant, contract, or other
agreement only to the extent that funds are available and consistent 
with any and all limitations of cost clauses or provisions, if any, 
contained therein.  Acceptance of the rate agreed to herein is 
predicated upon all the following conditions: (1) that no costs 
other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were included 
in its indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that all such 
costs are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable 
under the governing and applicable cost principles; (2) that the 
same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed 
as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs have been accorded 
consistent accounting treatment; and (4) that the information 
provided by the contractor/grantee, which was used as the basis 
for the acceptance of the rate(s) agreed to herein and expressly 
relied upon by the Government in negotiating and accepting the 
said rates, is not subsequently found to be materially incomplete 
or inaccurate.

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The predetermined rates contained in Section I 
of this agreement is based on the accounting system in effect at the 
time this agreement was negotiated. Changes to the method(s) of 
accounting for costs which affects the amount of reimbursement 
resulting from the use of this rate requires the express and written 
approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant negotiating 
agency for the Government prior to implementation of any such changes.  
Such changes include but are not limited to changes in the charging 
of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure on the 
part of the grantee/contractor to obtain the required approval may 
result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C.  PREDETERMINED FIXED RATES: The predetermined rates contained in 
this agreement are not subject to adjustment in accordance with the 
provisions of OMB Circular A-21, subject to the limitations contained 
in Part A of this section.

D.  CARRY-FORWARD AMOUNTS: The predetermined rates set forth in 
Section I of this agreement are inclusive of carry-forward amounts 
from FY 1995.  The carry-forward amount established in the FY 1995 
Final Rate and Carrry-forward Negotiation Agreement is liquidated in its
entirety and represents a ($341,800) institution over-recovery.

E.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES: The rate set forth in SECTION I 
hereof was negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set 
forth in OMB Circular A-88. Accordingly, such rate shall be applied, 
to the extent provided in such circular, to grants and contracts to 
which OMB Circular A-21 is applicable, subject to any limitations in 
part A of this section. Copies of this document may be provided by 
either party to other Federal agencies which have or intend to issue or
award grants and/or contracts to Virginia Institute of Marine Science 
to use the stated rate or to otherwise provide such agencies with 
documentary notice of this agreement and its terms and conditions.
