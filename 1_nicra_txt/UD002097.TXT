                       DISTRIBUTION BASES

The following bases are applicable to the above cited rates:

(a)  Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC), as defined in OMB Circular A-21, 
consisting of all salaries and wages, fringe benefits, materials and 
supplies, services, travel and subgrants and subcontracts up to the 
first $25,000 of each subgrant or subcontract (regardless of the 
period covered by the subgrant or subcontract).  Equipment, capital 
expenditures, charges for patient care and tuition remission, 
rental costs, scholarships, and fellowships as well as the portion 
of each subgrant and subcontract in excess of $25,000 shall be excluded.

(b)  Direct Labor Dollars (excluding temporary labor).

                         APPLICABLE TO

(1)  Applies to DOD contracts awarded before November 30, 1993, all 
     Non-DOD Instruments, and all DOD Grants.

(2)  Applies to only DOD contracts awarded on or after 
     November 30, 1993 in accordance with and under the authority of 
     DFARS 231.303(1).  See Section II, Part E thereof.

                                                                  
SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                                                                  
A.  LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I of this 
agreement is expressly subject to any statutory or administrative 
limitations and is applicable to a given grant, contract, or other 
agreement only to the extent that funds are available and consistent 
with any and all limitations of cost clauses or provisions, if any, 
contained therein.  Acceptance of any or all of the rates agreed to 
herein is predicated upon all the following conditions: (1) that no 
costs other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were 
included in its indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that 
all such costs are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor 
and allowable under the governing and applicable cost principles; 
(2) that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs 
are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs 
have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) 
that the information provided by the contractor/grantee, which
was used as the basis for the acceptance of the rate(s) agreed 
to herein and expressly relied upon by the Government in 
accepting the said rates, is not subsequently found to be 
materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The predetermined rates contained in Section I 
of this agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at the 
time this agreement was established.  Changes to the method(s) of 
accounting for costs which affects the amount of reimbursement 
resulting from the use of these rates requires the express and written 
approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant negotiating
agency for the Government prior to implementation of any such changes.  
Such changes include but are not limited to changes in the charging of 
a particular type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure on the 
part of the grantee/contractor to obtain the required approval may 
result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C.  PREDETERMINED RATES: The predetermined facility and administrative 
cost and fringe benefits rates contained in this agreement are not 
subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of OMB 
Circular A-21, subject to the limitations contained in Part A of 
this section.

D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES: The rates set forth in SECTION I 
hereof were established in accordance with and under the authority 
set forth in OMB Circular A-21. Accordingly, such rates shall be 
applied, to the extent provided in such circular, to grants and 
contracts to which OMB Circular A-21 is applicable, subject to any 
limitations in part A of this section.  Copies of this document 
may be provided by either party to other Federal agencies which 
have or intend to issue or award grants and/or contracts to 
Wentworth Institute of Technology  to use the stated rates or 
to otherwise provide such agencies with documentary notice of 
this agreement and its terms and conditions.

E.  APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DOD CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS:
     1.  Signature of this agreement by the authorized representatives 
of Wentworth Institute of Technology and the Government, acknowledges 
and affirms the institution's request for waiver for fiscal year 1997 
only, of the prohibition contained in DFARS 231.303(1) and the 
Government's exercise of its discretion under DFARS 231.303(2) to 
waive the prohibition in DFARS 231.303(1).  The waiver request by 
Wentworth Institute of Technology is made to simplify the university's
overall management of DOD cost reimbursements under DOD contracts.

     2.   In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless 
waived by the institution) may be placed on the reimbursement of 
otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred by an institution of 
higher education under a DOD contract awarded on or after 
November 30, 1993, unless the same limitation is applied uniformly 
to all other organizations performing similar work.  It has been 
determined by the Department of Defense that such limitation is not 
being uniformly applied.  Accordingly, the rates cited "(2)" of 
Section I, as explained under the title "APPLICABLE TO", 
do not reflect the application of the 26% limitation on 
administrative indirect costs imposed by OMB Circular A-21 
where as "(1)" does.
