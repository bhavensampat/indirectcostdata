fringe benefits, materials and supplies, services, travel, and 
subgrants and subcontracts up to the first $25,000 of each subgrant 
or subcontract (regardless of the period covered by the subgrant or 
subcontract).  Equipment, capital expenditures, charges for tuition 
remission, rental costs (in accordance with Cornell's Form CASB-2 
Disclosure Statement), scholarships and fellowships, as well as the 
portion of each subgrant and subcontract in excess of $25,000 shall 
be excluded from modified total direct costs.


                          APPLICABLE TO

(1) Applies to all DoD contracts and subcontracts awarded on or 
after November 30, 1993 in accordance with and under the authority of 
DFARS 231.303(1).  See Section II, Part F hereof.

(2) Applies to all DOD contracts and subcontracts awarded or issued 
before November 30, 1993, all Non-DOD instruments, and all DOD 
grants.  See Section II, Part F hereof.
                                                             

SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                                                                  

A. LIMITATIONS  

Use of the rates contained in this agreement is subject to any 
statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable to a 
given grant, contract or other agreement only to the extent that
funds are available and consistent with any and all limitations of 
cost clauses or provisions, if any, contained therein.  Acceptance 
of the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon the following 
conditions: (1) that no costs other than those incurred by the 
grantee/contractor were included in its Facilities and Administrative
cost pool as finally accepted and that such costs are legal obligations 
of the grantee/contractor and allowable under governing cost 
principles; (2) that the same costs that have been treated as indirect 
costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs, 
in like circumstances, have been accorded consistent accounting 
treatment; and (4) the information provided by the institution, which 
was used as the basis for acceptance of the rates agreed to herein and 
expressly relied upon by the Government in negotiating the said rates, 
is not subsequently found to be materially in-complete or inaccurate.

Note: Condition (1) is not intended to exclude otherwise allowable 
costs that are incurred by the State of New York in support of the 
Statutory Colleges of Cornell University.


B. ACCOUNTING CHANGES 

The fixed rates contained in this agreement are based on the accounting
system in effect at the time the agreement was negotiated. Changes to 
the method(s) of accounting for costs which affect the amount of 
reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates require the written 
approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant negotiating 
agency for the Government prior to implementation of any such changes. 
Such changes include but are not limited to changes in the charging of 
a particular type of cost from indirect to direct. Failure to obtain 
such approval may result in subsequent cost disallowances.


C. USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES

The rates in this agreement were established in accordance with the 
authority in Office Of Management and Budget Circular A-21, and should 
be applied to grants, contracts and other agreements covered by Office
of Management and Budget Circular A-21, subject to any limitations in 
A above.  The institution may provide copies of the agreement to other 
Federal agencies to give them early notification of the agreement 
contained herein.

D. FIXED RATES WITH CARRYFORWARD PROVISIONS   

     1.   This type of rate is considered final and not subject to
adjustment in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21 and 
the Federal Acquisition Regulation, subject to the limitations 
contained in Part A of this Section; except that the difference 
between the estimated costs and the actual costs of the period 
covered by the rate is carried forward as an adjustment to the 
rate computation of a subsequent period as discussed below.

     2.   The FY97 and FY98 rates contained in this agreement are based 
on estimates of the costs for FY97and FY98.  When actual costs for 
each period are determined, adjustments will be applied to a subsequent 
rate negotiation to recognize the difference between the estimated 
costs used to establish the fixed rates with carryforward provisions 
established herein and the negotiated actual costs for each period.

E. SPECIAL PROVISIONS

     1.   The fixed rates contained in this agreement are based, in 
part, on the institution's cost allocation special study for utility 
costs and an alternate allocation base for library costs.  The 
Government has not accepted the methodology or results of this 
special study or alternate allocation base, but has agreed to 
partially utilize the results of the study and alternate allocation 
base as a basis for negotiating the university's FY97 and FY98 F&A 
cost rates.  Use of such methodologies is on a non-precedent
setting basis, and does not imply Government acceptance of the 
results of the utility cost allocation special study or the library 
cost alternate allocation base in this or any other F&A cost rate 
negotiation.

     2.   The fixed rates set forth herein include the following 
amounts for the liquidation of carryforwards from prior fiscal 
years ($000's):

* These carryforward balances will be liquidated through the FY99 fixed
or predetermined rates.

     3.  Extraordinary electrical costs for the Laboratory Of Nuclear
Studies and extraordinary electrical costs, telecommunications costs 
and chilled water costs of the Theory Center program associated with, 
but not including normal utility costs for building maintenance are 
excluded from the modified total direct cost base.  In addition, the 
electrical costs of the NAIC Aericibo radio telescope site in Puerto 
Rico are also excluded from the modified total direct cost base.  The 
exclusion of these costs from the MTDC base does not represent an 
agreement that these exclusions are accepted for subsequent 
negotiation of future years' rates.

     4.  The purpose of this agreement is to establish fixed F&A cost 
rates with carryforward provisions for the period 1 July 1996 through 
30 June 1998.  These rates are based on Cornell University's proposal 
dated 8 April 1996, and the establishment of these rates by the 
Government based on the accounting systems and allocation methodologies 
contained in this proposal does not represent an agreement that these 
systems and methodologies are accepted for fiscal years 1997, 1998 or 
for any subsequent fiscal year's negotiation. The recommendations of 
the DCAA, Binghamton Branch, in Audit Report No. 6351-96C23000002 
were considered during the negotiation of these rates.


F. APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DOD CONTRACTS 

In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless waived by the
institution) may be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable
indirect costs incurred by an institution of higher education under a 
DOD contract awarded on or after November 30, 1993, unless the same 
limitation is applied uniformally to all other organizations 
performing similar work.  It has been determined by the Department 
of Defense that such limitation is not being uniformally applied.  
Accordingly, the rates cited (1) of Section I, as explained under 
the title "APPLICABLE TO" (1), do not reflect the application of 
the 26% limitation on administrative indirect costs imposed by OMB
Circular A-21 whereas (2) does so.
