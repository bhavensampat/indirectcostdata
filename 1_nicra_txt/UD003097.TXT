SECTION II - GENERAL                                                    

A.   LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is 
subject to any statutory or administrative limitations and is 
applicable to a given grant or contract only to the extent that 
funds are available.  Acceptance of the rates agreed to herein is 
predicated upon all of the following conditions: (1) that no costs 
other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were included 
in this indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that such costs 
are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under 
governing cost principles, (2) that the same costs that have been 
treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs, (3) 
that similar types of costs have been accorded consistent 
accounting treatment, and (4) that the information provided by 
the grantee/contractor which was used as a basis for acceptance 
of the rates agreed to herein, and expressly relied upon by the 
Government in negotiating and accepting the said rates is not 
subsequently found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.          


B.   ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The fixed rates contained in Section I of 
this agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at the 
time the agreement was negotiated.  Changes to the method(s) of 
accounting for costs which affect the amount of reimbursement 
resulting from the use of these rates require the prior approval 
of the authorized representative of the cognizant negotiation 
agency.  Such changes include but are not limited to changes in 
the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct.  
Failure to obtain such approval may result in subsequent cost 
disallowances.

C.   USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in Section I 
were negotiated in accordance with and under the authority contained 
in OMB Circular A-21.  Accordingly, such rates shall be applied to 
the extent provided in such Circular to grants and contracts to 
which OMB Circular A-21 applies, subject to any limitations in part 
A of this section.  Copies of this document may be provided by 
either party to other federal agencies which have or intend to 
issue or award sponsored agreements using these rates or to 
otherwise provide such agencies with documentary notice of this 
agreement and its terms and conditions.

D.   LIQUIDATION OF PRIOR YEAR CARRYFORWARD AMOUNTS:      
The fixed rates set forth herein include the liquidation of the 
following carryforward amounts from prior years:

                     ON CAMPUS

The FY97 On Campus fixed rate includes the complete liquidation of the 
entire remaining $9,692,183 overrecovery balance from the FY94 final 
carryforward amount, as well as the complete liquidation of the 
$344,000 final underrecovery carryforward from FY95.  The $344,000 
amount supersedes and replaces the previously estimated FY95 
underrecovery amount of $535,000 which was referenced in the FY97 
provisional rate agreement.

The FY97 On Campus fixed rate also includes the liquidation of a 
$1,699,000 estimated underrecovery carryforward from FY96.  When the 
final carryforward for FY96 is determined, the $1,699,000 estimated 
underrecovery carryforward amount will be credited against the FY96 
final carryforward in order to calculate the remaining unliquidated
carryforward balance which will be liquidated through a future year's 
indirect cost rate.

                     OFF CAMPUS

The FY97 Off Campus fixed rate includes the complete liquidation of 
the entire remaining $1,714,265 overrecovery balance from the FY94 
final carryforward amount, as well as the complete liquidation of the 
$1,106,000 final overrecovery carryforward from FY95.  The $1,106,000 
amount supersedes and replaces the previously estimated FY95 
overrecovery amount of $395,000 which was referenced in the FY97 
provisional rate agreement.

The FY97 Off Campus fixed rate also includes the liquidation of a 
$2,480,000 estimated underrecovery carryforward from FY96.  When the 
final carryforward for FY96 is determined, the estimated carryforward 
amount of $2,480,000 will be credited against the FY96 final 
carryforward in order to calculate the remaining unliquidated 
carryforward balance which will be liquidated through a future 
year's indirect cost rate.

F.   SPECIAL REMARKS: 

     1.  Off Campus rates are used when the preponderance of effort is 
performed at Lincoln Laboratory, Haystack Observatory or other 
off-site locations.

     2.  ONR letter of 17 August 1982 approving treatment of tuition 
remission was considered in establishing these provisional rates.

     3.  The fixed rates contained in this agreement are based, 
in part, on the institution's cost allocation special study for 
utility costs and an alternate allocation base for library costs.  
The Government has not accepted the methodology or results of this 
special study or alternate allocation base, but has agreed to 
partially utilize the results of the study and alternate allocation 
base as a basis for negotiating the university's FY 97 and FY98 fixed 
indirect cost rates.  Use of such methodologies is on a non-precedent 
setting basis, and does not imply Government acceptance of the results 
of the utility cost allocation special study or the library cost 
alternate allocation base in this or any other indirect cost rate 
negotiation.

     4.  The purpose of this agreement is to establish fixed indirect 
cost rates for the period 1 July 1996 through 30 June 1998.  These 
rates are based on MIT's proposal dated 9 May 1996 as  revised on 
21 June 1996, and the establishment of these rates by the Government 
based on the accounting systems and allocation methodologies contained 
in this proposal does not represent an agreement that these systems and
methodologies are accepted for fiscal years 1997, 1998 or for any 
subsequent year's rate negotiation.  The recommendations of the 
Defense Contract Audit Agency, Boston Branch in Audit Report 
#2177-96G23000001 were considered in the negotiation of these rates.

     5.  Signature of this agreement by the authorized representatives 
of MIT and the Government acknowledges and affirms the Institute's 
20 August 1996 request for waiver of the prohibition contained in 
DFARS 231.303 (1) and the Government's exercise of its discretion 
contained in DFARS 231.303 (2) to waive the prohibition in DFARS 
231.303 (1).   The waiver request by MIT is made to simplify the 
Institute's overall management of DOD cost reimbursent under DOD 
contracts.
