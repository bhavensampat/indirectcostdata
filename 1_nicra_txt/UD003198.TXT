                         APPLICABLE TO

     (1)  Applies to all Non-DoD Instruments, all DoD Grants and to DoD

     (2)  Applies to only DoD contracts awarded on or after 
November 30, 1993 in accordance with and under the authority of DFARS 
231.303(1).  See Section II, Part F hereof.

                                                                  
SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                                                                  

A. LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is subject 
to any statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable to a 
given grant, contract or other agreement only to the extent that funds 
are available and consistent with any and all limitations of cost 
clauses or provisions, if any, contained therein.  Acceptance of any 
or all of the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon all the 
following conditions: (1) that no costs other than those incurred by 
the grantee/contractor were included in its indirect cost pool as 
finally accepted and that all such costs are legal obligations of the 
grantee/contractor and allowable under governing cost principles; (2) 
that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not 
claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs, in like 
circumstances, have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; 
and (4) that the information provided by the contractor/grantee, 
which was used as the basis for the acceptance of the rates agreed 
to herein and expressly relied upon by the Government in negotiating 
the said rates, is not subsequently found to be materially
incomplete or inaccurate.

B. ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The rates contained in Section I of this 
agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at the time 
this agreement was negotiated. Changes to the method(s) of accounting 
for costs, which affects the amount of reimbursement resulting from 
the use of these rates, require the written approval of the 
authorized representative of the cognizant negotiating agency for 
the Government prior to implementation of any such changes.  Such 
changes include but are not limited to changes in the charging of 
a particular type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure to 
obtain such approval may result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C. FIXED RATES WITH CARRY-FORWARD PROVISIONS:  The fixed rates 
contained in this agreement are based on estimates of the costs for 
FY 1998. When actual costs for this fiscal year are determined, 
adjustments will be applied to the next subsequent rate negotiation 
to recognize the difference between the FY 1998 estimated costs 
used to establish the fixed rates and the negotiated actual 
FY 1998 costs. 

D. PREDETERMINED RATES:  The predetermined rates contained in this
agreement are not subject to adjustment in accordance with the 
provisions of OMB Circular A-21, subject to the limitations 
contained in Part A of this section. 

E. CARRY-FORWARD AMOUNTS:     

1.  LIQUIDATION OF ARL (INTERNAL) PRIOR YEAR CARRYFORWARD AMOUNTS:  
Prior to FY 1997, the ARL operated under an omnibus contract 
issued by the Department Of The Navy (Navy).  ARL charged all of 
its operating costs to the Navy omnibus contract.  In order to 
equitably spread costs among funding sources when ARL received 
awards from non-Navy sources, ARL developed Authorized Absence 
rates and Internal Overhead rates which were applied to all 
non-Navy business.  The Navy omnibus contract was then credited 
for the direct and indirect costs that ARL charged to non-Navy
awards.  Annual carryforward amounts were liquidated through 
adjustments to subsequent ARL fixed rates.

Beginning in FY 1997, the Navy will no longer reimburse all of ARL's
operating costs under a single omnibus contract.  Instead, each order
that ARL receives (whether Navy or non-Navy) will be individually 
priced.  This arrangement will automatically spread ARL's total 
operating costs over its total (Navy and non-Navy) business base, 
and will preclude the continued distribution of costs and  
carryforward amounts in the manner described above.  Accordingly, 
the parties have agreed upon the following two-year transition 
mechanism for liquidating the carryforward balance that remained 
as of the end of  FY 1996 (the final year of the Navy omnibus 
contract).

Carryforward balances prior to FY 1994 and a portion of the FY 1994
carryforward balance have been liquidated through previous adjustments 
to ARL's Authorized Absence and Internal Overhead rates.  The 
Authorized Absence and Internal Overhead cumulative non-Navy 
carryforward underrecovery balance for the remainder of  FY 1994, 
FY 1995, and FY 1996 is $388,632.  A non-Navy Internal Overhead rate 
will be created for FY 1997 and FY 1998 for the purpose of liquidating 
the $388,632 underrecovery carryforward.  The ARL's  FY 1997 and 
FY 1998 Navy Internal Overhead rates will be reduced to reflect 
corresponding credits of $175,442 in FY 1997, and $213,190 in 
FY 1998.  This arrangement will complete the equitable distribution 
of all remaining carryforward amounts between the Navy and 
non-Navy sources.

The special non-Navy Internal Overhead rate will be discontinued after
the  FY 1998 transition year, and effective with FY 1999, the ARL will
revert to a single Internal Overhead rate applicable to all of ARL's
business.

2.  Excluding the ARL Internal Rate carryforward treatment described
above, the carry-forward amounts established by the Negotiation
Agreement, FY 1995 Final Rates And Carry Forward, dated May 12, 1997 
are hereby liquidated in their entirety (amounts shown in $000's):

F. APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DoD CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS:  
In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless waived by 
the institution) may be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise
allowable indirect costs incurred by an institution of higher 
education under a DOD contract awarded on or after 
November 30, 1993, unless the same limitation is applied 
uniformally to all other organizations performing similar work.  
It has been determined by the Department of Defense that such 
limitation is not being uniformally applied.  Accordingly, the 
rates cited (2) of Section I, as explained under the title 
"APPLICABLE TO" (2), do not reflect the application of the 26% 
limitation on administrative indirect costs imposed by OMB 
Circular A-21 where as (1) does so. 


G. USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in Section I
hereof were negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set
forth in OMB Circular A-21.  Accordingly, such rates shall be applied 
to the extent provided in such circular to grants and contracts to 
which OMB Circular A-21 is applicable, subject to any limitations in 
part A of this section. Copies of this document may be provided by 
either party to other Federal agencies which have or intend to issue 
or award grants and contracts using these rates or to otherwise 
provide such agencies with documentary notice of this agreement and 
its terms and conditions.
