                                   Applicable To

(1)  Applies to all DoD contracts and subcontracts awarded or issued 
before November 30, 1993, all Non-DoD instruments, and all DoD grants.  
See Section II, Part E hereof.
 
(2)  Applies to all DoD contracts awarded or issued on or after 
November 30, 1993 in accordance with and under the authority of DFARS 
231.303(1).  See Section II, Part E hereof.
                                                                                                                                                                     
SECTION II - GENERAL                                                    
                                                                                                                                                             

A.   LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is 
subject to any statutory or administrative limitations and is 
applicable to a given grant or contract only to the extent that funds 
are available.  Acceptance of the rates agreed to herein is 
predicated upon all of the following conditions: (1) that no costs 
other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in 
this indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that such costs are 
legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under 
governing cost principles, (2) that the same costs that have been 
treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs, (3) that 
similar types of costs have been accorded consistent accounting
treatment, and (4) that the information provided by the 
grantee/contractor which was used as a basis for acceptance of 
the rates agreed to herein, and expressly relied upon by the
Government in negotiating and accepting the said rates is not 
subsequently found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.          

B.   ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The rates contained in Section I of this 
agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at the time 
the agreement was negotiated.  Changes to the method(s) of 
accounting for costs which affect the amount of reimbursement 
resulting from the use of these rates require the prior approval 
of the authorized representative of the cognizant negotiation 
agency.  Such changes include but are not limited to changes in 
the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct. 
Failure to obtain such approval may result in subsequent cost 
disallowances.

C.   USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in 
Section  I were negotiated in accordance with and under the 
authority set forth in OMB Circular A-21.
Accordingly, such rates shall be applied to the extent provided 
in such Circular to grants and contracts to which OMB Circular 
A-21 applies, subject to any limitations in part A of this 
section.  Copies of this document may be provided by either 
party to other federal agencies which have or intend to issue 
or award sponsored agreements using these rates or to 
otherwise provide such agencies with documentary notice of this 
agreement and its terms and conditions.

D.   PREDETERMINED RATES: This type of rate is considered final, 
and not subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions 
of OMB Circular A-21 and the Federal Acquisition regulation, 
subject to the limitations contained in Part A of this Section.

E.   APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DOD 
CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS:  In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no 
limitation (unless waived by the institution) may be placed on 
the reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs 
incurred by an institution of higher education under a DoD 
contract awarded on or after November 30, 1993, unless the same 
limitation is applied uniformly to all other organizations 
performing similar work.  It has been determined by the 
Department of Defense that such limitation is not being 
uniformly applied.  Accordingly, the rates cited (2) of 
Section I, as explained under title "APPLICABLE TO" (2), do not 
reflect the application of the 26% limitation on administrative 
indirect costs imposed by OMB A-21, whereas (1) does so.


F.   SPECIAL REMARKS:

    The purpose of this agreement is to establish predetermined 
facilities and administrative rates for the period of 
1 July 1997 through 30 June 2000.  Rates established in 
Section I above are based on the institution's proposal dated 
30 December 1996.
