                       SPECIAL REMARKS

APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DOD CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS:  
In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless waived by 
the institution) may be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise 
allowable indirect costs incurred by an institution of higher
education under a DOD contract awarded on or after 
November 30, 1993, unless the same limitation is applied uniformly 
to all other organizations performing similar work.  It has been 
determined by the Department of Defense that such limitation is 
not being uniformly applied.  Accordingly, the rates cited (2) of 
Section I, as explained under the title "APPLICABLE TO" do not 
reflect the application of the 26% limitation on administrative 
indirect costs imposed by OMB Circular A-21 whereas (1) does so.

Please indicate your acceptance of the FY 96 actual rates and 
carryforward adjustments by signature in the space provided below.  
The terms of this negotiation agreement are subject to all 
regulations and statutes applicable to any contract, grant, or 
other agreement including the provisions of OMB Circular A-21.  
The terms of this negotiation agreement will not change any 
monetary ceilings of any individual Federal contract, grant, 
or other agreement with GIT/GTRC.
