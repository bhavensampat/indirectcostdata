A.  LIMITATION: Use of the rates set forth in Section I is  subject to 
any statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable to a 
given grant, contract, or other agreement only to the extent that funds 
are available and consistent with any and all limitations of cost 
clauses or provisions, if any, contained therein.   Acceptance of any 
or all of the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon all the 
following conditions: (1) that no costs other than those incurred by 
the contractor/grantee were included in its indirect cost pool as 
finally accepted and that all such costs are legal obligations of 
the contractor/grantee and allowable under governing cost 
principles; (2) that the same costs that have been treated 
as indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar 
types of costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; 
and (4) the information provided by the contractor/grantee,  which 
was used as the basis for acceptance of the rates agreed to herein 
and expressly relied upon by the Government in negotiating the 
said rates, is not subsequently found to be materially incomplete 
or inaccurate.

B  ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The rates contained in Section I of this 
agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at the time 
this agreement was negotiated.  Changes to the method(s) of accounting 
for costs, which affect the amount of reimbursement resulting from 
the use of these rates, require the written approval of the 
authorized representative of the cognizant negotiating agency for 
the Government prior to implementation of any such changes.  Such 
changes include, but are not limited to, changes in the charging of a 
particular type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure to obtain 
such approval may result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C.  FIXED RATES AND CARRYFORWARD PROVISIONS:

1.  This type of rate is considered final and not subject to 
adjustment in accordance with the provisions of OMB circular A-21 and 
the Federal Acquistion Regulation, subject to the limitations 
contained in Part A of this section, except that the difference 
between the estimated costs and the actual costs of the period 
covered by the rate is carried forward as an adjustment to the rate 
computation of a subsequent period as discussed below.

2.  The rates contained in this agreement are based on estimates 
of the costs for FY1998.  When actual costs for this period are 
determined adjustments will be applied to the FY1999 negotiated 
fixed rates to recognize the difference between the estimated 
FY1998 costs used to establish the fixed rates and the 
negotiated actual FY1998 costs.

3.  The fringe benefit rates set forth herein include the complete 
liquidation of the following carryforward amounts which resulted from 
determination of the actual fringe benefit costs for FY1997.

(*)   The University Of Illinois At Urbana-Champaign has established a 
self-insurance trust fund for the purpose of paying workers' 
compensation claims for employees paid from sponsored accounts.  It is 
understood and agreed that the university shall have no right of 
recapture of the reserves in the self-insurance trust fund.  In the 
event that the university terminates the self-insurance trust fund and 
purchases workers' compensation insurance, any unencumbered reserves 
in the self-insurance trust fund shall be used to pay the workers' 
compensation insurance premiums until such reserves have been exhausted.

As of 7/1/97 the self-insurance trust fund  had  a reserve balance of 
$668,754.  The reserve balance is defined as the account balance less 
discounted liabilities associated with claims currently being paid.  
The $668,754 reserve balance is expected to be reduced by approximately 
$85,319 in FY1998, calculated as follows: the sum of the actuarial 
funding recommendation at the mean confidence level, plus 
administrative expense, less projected interest income, less income 
generated by the nominal .01% rate assessment against the salary and 
wage base.  The university believes that a minimum reserve balance of 
$500,000 is necessary in order to pay routine workers' compensation 
claims plus such extraordinary claims as a death, or two- three 
serious injuries in any given year. It is agreed that the university 
will not increase the .01% rate unless the year-end reserve balance 
in the self-insurance trust fund falls below $500,000.


D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in Section I 
hereof were negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set 
forth in OMB Circular A-21. Accordingly, such rates shall be applied 
to the extent provided in such Circular to grants, contracts and 
other agreements to which OMB Circular A-21 is applicable, subject 
to any limitations in part A of this section.  Copies of this 
document may be provided by either party to other Federal agencies 
which have or intend to issue or award grants and contracts using 
these rates or to otherwise provide such agencies with documentary 
notice of this agreement and its terms and conditions.
