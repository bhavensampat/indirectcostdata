A.  LIMITATION: Use of the rates set forth in Section I is  subject to 
any statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable to a 
given grant, contract, or other agreement only to the extent that 
funds are available and consistent with any and all limitations of 
cost clauses or provisions, if any, contained therein.   Acceptance 
of any or all of the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon all 
the following conditions: (1) that no costs other than those incurred 
by the contractor/grantee were included in its indirect cost pool as 
finally accepted and that all such costs are legal obligations of 
the contractor/grantee and allowable under governing cost principles; 
(2) that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are 
not claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs have 
been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) the 
information provided by the contractor/grantee,  which was used as 
the basis for acceptance of the rates agreed to herein and 
expressly relied upon by the Government in negotiating the said
rates, is not subsequently found to be materially incomplete or 
inaccurate.

B  ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The rates contained in Section I of this 
agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at the 
time this agreement was negotiated.  Changes to the method(s) 
of accounting for costs, which affect the amount of reimbursement 
resulting from the use of these rates,  require the written
approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant
negotiating agency for the Government prior to implementation of 
any such changes.  Such changes include, but are not limited to, 
changes in the charging of a particular type of cost from
indirect to direct.  Failure to obtain such approval may result 
in subsequent cost disallowances.

C.  FIXED RATES AND CARRYFORWARD PROVISIONS:

1. This type of rate is considered final and not subject to
adjustment in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular 
A-21 and the Federal Acquistion Regulation, subject to the
limitations contained in Part A of this section, except that 
the difference between the estimated costs and the actual 
costs of the period covered by the rate is carried forward as 
an adjustment to the rate computation of a subsequent period 
as discussed below.

2.  The rates contained  in this agreement are based on 
estimates of the costs for FY1998.  When actual costs for this 
period are determined adjustments will be applied to the FY1999 
negotiated fixed rates to recognize the difference between the 
estimated FY1998 costs used to establish the fixed rates and 
the negotiated actual FY1998 costs.

3. The fringe benefit rates set forth herein include the 
complete liquidation of the following carryforward amounts 
which resulted from determination of the actual fringe benefit 
costs for FY1997.

(*)   The University Of Illinois At Chicago has established a 
self-insurance trust fund for the purpose of paying workers' 
compensation claims for employees paid from sponsored accounts. 
It is understood and agreed that the university shall have no 
right of recapture of the reserves in the self-insurance trust 
fund.  In the event that the university terminates the 
self-insurance trust fund and purchases workers' compensation 
insurance, any unencumbered reserves in the self-insurance 
trust fund shall be used to pay the workers' compensation 
insurance premiums until such reserves have been exhausted.

As of 7/1/97 the self-insurance trust fund  had a reserve 
balance of  $426,792.  The reserve balance is defined as the 
account balance less discounted liabilities associated with 
claims currently being paid.  The $426,792 reserve balance is 
expected to be reduced by approximately $259,744 in FY1998, 
calculated as follows: the sum of the actuarial funding 
recommendation at the mean confidence level, plus 
administrative expense, less projected interest income, less
income generated by the .03% rate assessment against the salary 
and wage base.  The university believes that a reserve balance 
of not less than $250,000, and not more than $500,000 should be
sufficient to pay routine workers' compensation claims plus 
such extraordinary claims as a death, or two- three serious 
injuries in any given year. Accordingly, it is agreed that the 
university will reduce the .03% funding rate if the year-end 
reserve balance in the self-insurance trust fund exceeds 
$500,000, and will increase  the 0.03% funding rate if the 
year-end reserve balance in the self-insurance trust fund 
falls below $250,000.

D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in 
Section I hereof  were negotiated in accordance with and under 
the authority set forth in OMB Circular A-21.  Accordingly, 
such rates shall be applied to the extent provided in such 
Circular to grants, contracts and other agreements to which 
OMB Circular A-21 is applicable, subject to any limitations 
in part A of this section.  Copies of this document may be 
provided by either party to other Federal agencies which 
have or intend to issue or award grants and contracts using 
these rates or to otherwise provide such agencies with 
documentary notice of this agreement and its terms and 
conditions.
