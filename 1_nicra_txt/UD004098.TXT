SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS


A.  LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is subject 
to any statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable to a 
given grant, contract or other agreement only to the extent that funds 
are available and consistent with any and all limitations of cost 
clauses or provisions, if any, contained therein.  Acceptance of the 
rates agreed to herein is predicated upon all of the following 
conditions: (1) that no costs other than those incurred by 
the grantee/contractor were included in this indirect cost pool as 
finally accepted and that such costs are legal obligations of the 
grantee/contractor and allowable under governing cost principles; (2) 
that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not 
claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs have been 
accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) that the 
information provided by the grantee/contractor, which was used as 
the basis for acceptance of the rates agreed to herein and expressly 
relied upon by the Government in negotiating and accepting the said 
rates, is not subsequently found to be materially incomplete or 
inaccurate.

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The rates contained in Section I of this 
agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at the time 
the agreement was negotiated.  Changes to the method(s) of 
accounting for costs which affect the amount of reimbursement 
resulting from the use of these rates require the written approval 
of the authorized representative of the cognizant negotiating agency 
for the Government prior to implementation of any such changes.
Such changes include but are not limited to changes in the charging
of a particular type of costs from indirect to direct.  Failure 
to obtain such approval may result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C.  PREDETERMINED RATES: The predetermined rates contained in this 
agreement are not subject to adjustment in accordance with the 
provisions of OMB Circular A-21, subject to the limitations 
contained in Part A of this section.

D.  FIXED RATES CARRYFORWARD PROVISIONS: The fixed rates in this 
agreement are based on estimates of the costs for FY 1998 and 
FY 1999.  When actual costs for these periods are determined, an 
adjustment will be made to the rates of a future year to recognize 
the difference between the FY 1998 estimated costs used to establish 
the fixed rates and the negotiated actual FY 1998 costs and the 
difference between the FY 1999 estimated costs used to
establish the fixed rates and the negotiated actual FY 1999 costs .

E.  CARRY-FORWARD AMOUNTS: The fixed rates set forth in Section I 
of this agreement are inclusive of carry-forward amounts as follow:

F.  APPLICATION OF FACILITY & ADMINISTRATIVE COST RATES TO DoD
CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS: In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation 
(unless waived by the institution) may be placed on the reimbursement 
of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred by an institution of 
higher education under a DoD contract awarded on or after 
November 30, 1993, unless the same limitation is applied uniformly to 
all other organizations performing similar work.  It has been 
determined by DoD that such limitation is not being uniformly applied.

title "APPLICABLE TO" (2), do not reflect the application of the 26% 
limitation on administrative indirect costs imposed by OMB Circular 
A-21 where as (1) does.

hereof were negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set 
forth in OMB Circular A-21. Accordingly, such rates shall be applied 
to the extent provided in such circular to grants and contracts to 
which OMB Circular A-21 is applicable, subject to any limitations in 
part A of this section.  Copies of this document may be provided by 
either party to other Federal agencies which have or intend to issue 
or award grants and contracts using these rates or to otherwise
provide such agencies with documentary notice of this agreement and 
its terms and conditions.
