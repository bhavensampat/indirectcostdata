cost rates proposal dated 12 January 1996 and DCAA Audit Report No. 6381-96C10150001 dated 1 January 1997.  These rates have been determined in accordance
with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21.

                         Applicable To

                          Carryforwards

The carryforward amounts resulting from establishment of FY 95 actual costs are as
follows:

                         FY95 Carryforward
Rate Category                   Amount  ($000's)           
                     
Onsite Overhead (1)           $149 (O)

Onsite Overhead (2)                                $636 (O)
                                                     
Offsite Overhead (1)               $    2 (O)

Offsite Overhead (2)               $  25 (O)

SEI (1)/(2)                        $  70 (U)


(O)  Designates Overrecovery          (U)  Designates Underrecovery


The FY 95 negotiated carryforward amounts shown above will be liquidated through 
adjustments to future years' fixed, predetermined, or postdetermined rates.  The
carryforward amounts from several prior fiscal years have not yet been determined, due
to the recent DCIS investigation at Carnegie Mellon University, which continued from
1993 until 1997.  When Carnegie Mellon University and the Government have negotiated
each rate category's under/overrecovery carryforward amounts from these prior fiscal
years, it is intended to combine them with the above FY 95 carryforward amounts for
each rate category, and credit the cumulative totals with the several carryforward
liquidation adjustments that have already been made to certain years' fixed rates.  The
remaining unliquidated carryforward balances for each rate category will then be
scheduled for liquidation through adjustments to future years' fixed, predetermined, or
postdetermined rates.  Details of this carryforward liquidation methodology will be
displayed in a comprehensive matrix which will be included in a future final indirect cost
rate agreement.

                                                
                          Special Remarks


A.  Application Of Indirect Cost Rates To DOD Contracts/Subcontracts

In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless waived by the institution) may
be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred by an
institution of higher education under a DoD contract awarded on or after November 30,
1993, unless the same limitation is applied uniformly to all other organizations performing
similar work.  It has been determined by the Department of Defense that such limitation
is not being uniformly applied.  Accordingly, the rates cited (1) of Section I, as explained
under title "APPLICABLE TO" (1), do not reflect the application of the 26% limitation on
administrative indirect costs imposed by OMB A-21, whereas (2) does so.


B.   Qualification; The parties have agreed to the actual rates set forth above
      with the following understandings:


1.  The actual rates contained in this agreement are based, in part, on the institution's
1995 cost allocation special study for utility cost.  The Government has not accepted the
methodology or results of this special study, but has agreed to partially utilize the results
of the study as a basis for negotiating the university's FY95 actual indirect cost rates. 
Use of such methodology is on a non-precedent setting basis, and does not imply
Government acceptance of the results of the utility cost allocation special study in this or
any other indirect cost rate negotiation.


2.  The purpose of this agreement is to establish actual F&A rates for the period 
1 July 1994 through 30 June 1995.  Rates established in Section I above are based on
Carnegie Mellon University's proposal dated 12 January 1996, and the establishment of
these rates by the Government, based on the accounting systems and allocation
methodologies contained in this proposal, does not represent an agreement that these
systems and methodologies are accepted for FY95,  or for any subsequent fiscal year's
rate negotiation.  The recommendations of the Defense Contract Audit Agency,
Pittsburgh Branch in Audit Report No. 6381- 96C10150001 were considered during the
negotiation of these rates.  



Please indicate your acceptance of the FY95 actual rates and carryforward adjustments
by signature in the space provided below.  The terms of this negotiation agreement are
subject to all regulations and statutes applicable to any contract, grant, or other
agreement including the provisions of OMB Circular A-21.  The terms of this negotiation
agreement will not change any monetary ceilings of any individual Federal contract,
grant, or other agreement with Carnegie Mellon University.
