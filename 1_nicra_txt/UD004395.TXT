                   SPECIAL REMARKS


(a)   The actual rates contained in this negotiation agreement are
based on the standard allocation methodologies allowed under OMB
Circular A-21 except as follows:

The FY 95 overhead rate established herein is based on a partial
application of the results of Polytechnic University's space
utilization alternate allocation base survey.  The Government's
agreement to the final overhead rate for FY 95 is non-precedent
setting, and does not imply Government acceptance of the results of
the space utilization alternate allocation base survey in this, or
any other indirect cost rate negotiation.

(b)  APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DoD CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS:  
In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless waived by the 
institution) may be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise 
allowable indirect costs incurred by an institution of higher education
under a DOD contract awarded on or after November 30, 1993, unless the 
same limitation is applied uniformly to all other organizations 
performing similar work.  It has been determined by the Department
of Defense that such limitation is not being uniformly applied.  
Accordingly, the rates cited (1) of Section I, as explained under the 
title "APPLICABLE TO" do not reflect the application of the 26%
limitation on administrative indirect costs imposed by OMB Circular 
A-21 whereas (2) does so.

Please indicate your acceptance of the FY 95 actual rates and 
carryforward  adjustments by signature in the space provided below.  
The terms of this negotiation agreement are subject to all regulations 
and statutes applicable to any contract, grant, or other agreement 
including the provisions of OMB Circular A-21.  The terms of this 
negotiation agreement will not change any monetary ceilings of any
individual Federal contract, grant, or other agreement with 
Polytechnic University.
