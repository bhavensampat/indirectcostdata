                       DISTRIBUTION BASES

The following bases are applicable to the above cited rates:

(a)  Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC), as defined in OMB
     Circular A-21, consists of all salaries and wages, 
     fringe benefits, materials and supplies, services, 
     travel and each subgrant and subcontract up to the 
     first $25,000 of each subgrant and subcontract 
     (regardless of the period covered by the subgrant or 
     subcontract).  Equipment, capital expenditures, 
     charges for patient care and tuition remission, rental 
     costs, scholarships, and fellowships as well as the 
     portion of each subgrant and subcontract in excess of
     $25,000 shall be excluded from modified total direct 
     costs.

(b)  Direct staff salaries and wages (including overtime 
     expense, straight and premium), allocated direct 
     labor , and employee leave benefits.

(c)  Direct staff salaries and wages (excluding overtime

     labor.

(d)  Direct staff and student salaries and wages  
     (excluding overtime expense, straight and premium, 
     and sabbatical leave).

                                                                 
SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                                                                  
A.  LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under 
Section I of this agreement is expressly subject to any 
statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable 
to a given grant, contract, or other agreement only to 
the extent that funds are available and consistent with 
any and all limitations of cost clauses or provisions, 
if any, contained therein.  Acceptance of any or all of
the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon all the 
following conditions: (1) that no costs other than those 
incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in its 
indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that all 
such costs are legal obligations of the grantee/
contractor and allowable under the governing and 
applicable cost principles; (2) that the same costs 
that have been treated as indirect costs are not 
claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of 
costs have been accorded consistent accounting 
treatment; and (4) that the information provided by 
the contractor/grantee, which was used as the basis 
for the acceptance of the rate(s) agreed to herein 
and expressly relied upon by the Government accepting 
the said rates, is not subsequently found to be 
materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The rates contained in 
Section I of this agreement are based on the 
accounting system in effect at the time this 
agreement was established. Changes to the method(s) 
of accounting for costs which affects the amount of 
reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates 
requires the express and written approval of the 
authorized representative of the cognizant 
negotiating agency for the Government prior to 
implementation of any such changes. Such changes 
include but are not limited to changes in the 
charging of a particular type of cost from 
indirect to direct.  Failure on the part of 
the grantee/contractor to obtain the required
approval may result in subsequent cost 
disallowances.

C. PREDETERMINED RATES: The predetermined 
indirect cost rate contained in this agreement 
is not subject to adjustment in accordance with 
the provisions of OMB Circular A-21, subject to the 
limitations contained in Part A of this section.

D. FIXED RATES: The fixed rates in this agreement 
are based on estimates of the costs for FY 1998.  
When actual costs for this period are determined, 
an adjustment will be made to the rates of a 
future year to recognize the difference between the 
FY 1998 estimated costs used to establish the fixed 
rates and the negotiated actual FY 1998 costs.

agreement are inclusive of carry-forward amounts
