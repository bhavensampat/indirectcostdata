*  Note: Since Cornell University had no DOD contract or subcontract 
business at this location in FY95, there is no FY95 carryforward for 
the uncapped rate at this location.

**  Note: A consolidated carryforward amount covering the capped and 
uncapped rates is shown, since the FY95 fixed capped/uncapped rates 
were identical, and the FY95 actual capped/uncapped
rates are also identical. The carryforward amounts shown above will 
be liquidated during a future fixed or predetermined rate negotiation.  
In the event that Cornell University changes to the use of 
postdetermined rates, the above carryforward amounts will be 
liquidated as part of the next postdetermined rates negotiation.

SPECIAL REMARKS

A.  Application Of Indirect Cost Rates To DOD Contracts 

In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless waived by the 
institution) may be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable 
indirect costs incurred by an institution of higher education under a 
DOD contract awarded on or after November 30, 1993, unless the same 
limitation is applied uniformally to all other organizations 
performing similar work.  It has been determined by the Department 
of Defense that such limitation is not being uniformly applied.  
Accordingly, the rates cited (1) of Section I, as explained under 
the title "APPLICABLE TO" (1), do not reflect the application of the 
26% limitation on administrative indirect costs imposed by OMB 
Circular A-21, whereas (2) does so.

B.  Utility Cost Special Study And Library Cost Alternate Allocation 
Base 

The actual rates contained in this agreement are based, in part, on 
the institution's cost allocation special study for utility costs 
and an alternate allocation base for library costs.  The Government 
has not accepted the methodology or results of this special study 
or alternate allocation base, but has agreed to partially utilize 
the results of the study and alternate allocation base as a basis for
negotiating the university's FY95 actual indirect cost rates.  Use 
of such methodologies is on a non-precedent setting basis, and 
does not imply Government acceptance of the results of the utility 
cost allocation special study or the library cost alternate 
allocation base in this or any other indirect cost rate negotiation.
     

Please indicate your acceptance of the FY 95 actual rates and 
carryforward adjustments by signature in the space provided below.  
The terms of this negotiation agreement are subject to all 
regulations and statutes applicable to any contract, grant, or 
other agreement including the provisions of OMB
Circular A-21.  The terms of this negotiation agreement will not 
change any monetary ceilings of any individual Federal contract, 
grant, or other agreement with Cornell University.
