SECTION II - GENERAL                                                    
                                                                                                                                                           
A.   LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under 
Section I is subject to any statutory or administrative 
limitations and is applicable to a given grant or contract 
only to the extent that funds are available.  Acceptance 
of the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon all of 
the following conditions: (1) that no costs other than 
those incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in 
the above indirect cost pools as finally accepted and that 
such costs are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor 
and allowable under governing cost principles, (2) that the 
same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not 
claimed as direct costs, (3) that similar types of costs 
have been accorded consistent accounting treatment, and (4)
that the information provided by the grantee/contractor 
which was used as a basis for acceptance of the rates 
agreed to herein, and expressly relied upon by the Government 
in negotiating and accepting the said rates is not 
subsequently found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.          


B.   ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The rates contained in Section I 
of this agreement are based on the accounting system in 
effect at the time the agreement was negotiated.   Changes 
to the method(s) of accounting for costs which affect the 
amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of these 
rates require the prior approval of the authorized
representative of the cognizant negotiation agency.  Such 
changes include but are not limited to changes in the 
charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to 
direct.  Failure to obtain such approval may result in 
subsequent cost disallowances.

C.   USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set 
forth in Section I were negotiated in accordance with and
under the authority set forth in OMB Circular A-122 and
the FAR. Accordingly, such rates shall be applied to the
extent provided in OMB Circular A-122 and the FAR to
grants and contracts to which OMB Circular A-122 and the 
FAR apply, subject to any limitations in part A of this 
section.  Copies of this document may be provided by 
either party to other federal agencies which have or 
intend to issue or award sponsored agreements using 
these rates or to otherwise provide such agencies with 
documentary notice of this agreement and its terms and 
conditions.


D.  LIQUIDATION OF PRIOR YEAR CARRYFORWARD AMOUNTS: Shown
below are the prior year carryforward amounts that are 
being liquidated through the FY99 provisional rates set 
forth above :


                    FRINGE BENEFITS

1.  The FY 99 "Full Fringe Benefit" rate set forth
above includes the liquidation of an estimated $18,000 
overrecovery amount from FY 97.  The FY 97 estimated 
carryforward amount liquidated herein will be credited 
against the FY97 negotiated final total carryforward
amount for the purpose of calculating any FY97 remaining
unliquidated carryforward balance.

2.  The FY 99 "Partial Fringe Benefit" rate set forth
above includes the liquidation of an estimated $5,000
overrecovery amount from FY 97.  The FY 97 estimated 
carryforward amount liquidated herein will be credited
against the FY97 negotiated final total carryforward
amount for the purpose of calculating any FY97 
remaining unliquidated carryforward balance.

                   To Be Liquidated

(U)  Denotes Underrecovery
(O)  Denotes Overrecovery

* The FY 97 estimated carryforward amount liquidated 
through the FY99 provisional G&A rate will be 
credited against the FY97 negotiated final total 
carryforward amount for the purpose of calculating 
any FY97 remaining unliquidated carryforward balance.

The prior year carryforwards shown in the above table 
resulted from fiscal years in which GTRI's fixed 
overhead rates and carryforward amounts were 
determined in accordance with the requirements of 
OMB Circular A-21.  The fixed rates and carryforward 
amounts for FY98 are also being determined in 
accordance with the requirements of OMB Circular A-21. 
Effective with FY99, GTRI's recovery of direct and 
indirect costs (indicated by the rates shown in 
Section I above) will be governed by the cost 
principles set forth at FAR Section 31.2.  The 
expected ratio of Government sponsored activities 
to non-Government sponsored activities in GTRI's 
G&A allocation base will be approximately the same 
as the corresponding ratio in its previous MTDC 
bases.  Therefore, all remaining prior year
carryforward amounts that were or will be
determined in accordance with OMB Circular A-21
will be liquidated by means of adjustments to GTRI's
FY99 and future G&A rates.


E.  SPECIAL REMARKS: The purpose of this agreement 
is to establish provisional fringe benefit rates 
and indirect cost rates for the period 1 July 1998 
through 30 June 1999.  The establishment of these 
rates by the Government based on the accounting 
systems and allocation methodologies in effect at 
the time this rate agreement is signed does not
represent an agreement that these systems and 
methodologies are accepted for fiscal year
1999, or for any subsequent year's rate 
negotiation.
