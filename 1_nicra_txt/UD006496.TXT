     fringe benefits, materials and supplies, services, travel, 
     subgrants and subcontracts up to $25,000 each, and excluding 
     50% of graduate student compensation regarded as tuition 
     remission.
                                         
                        Applicable To

(1)  Applies to all DoD contracts awarded or issued on or after
     November 30, 1993 in accordance with and under the authority
     of DFARS 231.303(1).  See Special Remarks below.

(2)  Applies to all DoD contracts and subcontracts awarded or
     issued before November 30, 1993, all Non-DoD instruments,
     and all DoD grants.  See Special Remarks below.

                        Carryforwards

The carryforward amounts resulting from establishment of FY96
actual costs are as follows:

                                FY96 Carryforward
Rate Category                   Amount  ($000's)           
                     
Onsite Overhead (1)/(2)         $1,452 (O)
                                              
Offsite Overhead (1)/(2)        $   11 (U)

SEI (1)/(2)                     $  613 (O)

(O)  Designates Overrecovery   (U)  Designates Underrecovery

The FY 96 negotiated carryforward amounts shown above will be
liquidated through adjustments to future years' fixed,
predetermined, or postdetermined rates.  The carryforward 
amounts from several prior fiscal years have not yet been 
determined, due to the recent DCIS investigation at Carnegie
Mellon University, which continued from 1993 until 1997.
When Carnegie Mellon University and the Government have negotiated
each rate category's under/overrecovery carryforward amounts from
these prior fiscal years, it is intended to combine them with the
above FY 96 carryforward amounts for each rate category, and credit
the cumulative totals with the several carryforward liquidation 
adjustments that have already been made to certain years' fixed
rates.  The remaining unliquidated carryforward balances for each
rate category will then be scheduled for liquidation through
adjustments to future years' fixed, predetermined, or
postdetermined rates.  Details of this carryforward liquidation
methodology will be displayed in a comprehensive matrix which will
be included in a future final indirect cost rate agreement.

                          Special Remarks

A.  Application Of Indirect Cost Rates To DOD Contracts/Subcontracts
In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless waived by the
institution) may be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable
indirect costs incurred by an institution of higher education under
a DoD contract awarded on or after November 30, 1993, unless the same
limitation is applied uniformly to all other organizations performing
similar work.  It has been determined by the Department of Defense 
that such limitation is not being uniformly applied.  Accordingly,
the rates cited (1) of Section I, as explained under title
"APPLICABLE TO" (1), do not reflect the application of the 26%
limitation on administrative indirect costs imposed by OMB A-21,
whereas (2) does so.

B.  Qualification; The parties have agreed to the actual rates
set forth above with the following understandings:

1.  The actual rates contained in this agreement are based, in part,
on the institution's 1995 cost allocation special study for utility
cost.  The Government has not accepted the methodology or results of
this special study, but has agreed to partially utilize the results
of the study as a basis for negotiating the university's FY96 
actual indirect cost rates.  Use of such methodology is on a 
non-precedent setting basis, and does not imply Government 
acceptance of the results of the utility cost allocation special
study in this or any other indirect cost rate negotiation.

2.  The purpose of this agreement is to establish actual F&A rates
for the period 1 July 1995 through 30 June 1996.  Rates established
in Section I above are based on Carnegie Mellon University's proposal
dated 31 January 1997, and the establishment of these rates by the
Government, based on the accounting systems and allocation 
methodologies contained in this proposal, does not represent an 
agreement that these systems and methodologies are accepted for 
FY96,  or for any subsequent fiscal year's rate negotiation.
The recommendations of the Defense Contract Audit Agency,
Pittsburgh Branch in Audit Report No. 6381- 97C10150001 were
considered during the negotiation of these rates.  

Please indicate your acceptance of the FY96 actual rates and
carryforward adjustments by signature in the space provided below.
The terms of this negotiation agreement are subject to all 
regulations and statutes applicable to any contract, grant, 
or other agreement including the provisions of OMB Circular A-21.
The terms of this negotiation agreement will not change any 
monetary ceilings of any individual Federal contract, grant, or
other agreement with Carnegie Mellon University.
