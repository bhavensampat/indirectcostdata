                     APPLICABLE TO

     (1)  Applies to all Non-DoD Instruments, all DoD Grants and
to DoD contracts awarded before November 30, 1993.

     (2)  Applies to only DoD contracts awarded on or after
November 30,1993 in accordance with and under the authority of
DFARS 231.303(1).  See Section II, Part F hereof.

                                                                  
SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

A. LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is
subject to any statutory or administrative limitations and is
applicable to a given grant, contract or other agreement only to
the extent that funds are available and consistent with any and
all limitations of cost clauses or provisions, if any, contained
therein.  Acceptance of any or all of the rates agreed to herein
is predicated upon all the following conditions: (1) that no costs
other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were included
in its indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that all such
costs are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and
allowable under governing cost principles; (2) that the same costs
that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct
costs; (3) that similar types of costs, in like circumstances, 
have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) that
the information provided by the contractor/grantee, which was used
as the basis for the acceptance of the rates agreed to herein and
expressly relied upon by the Government in negotiating the said
rates, is not subsequently found to be materially incomplete or
inaccurate.

B. ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The rates contained in Section I of this
agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at the
time this agreement was negotiated. Changes to the method(s) of
accounting for costs, which affects the amount of reimbursement
resulting from the use of these rates, require the written
approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant
negotiating agency for the Government prior to implementation
of any such changes.  Such changes include but are not limited
to changes in the charging of a particular type of cost from
indirect to direct.  Failure to obtain such approval may result
in subsequent cost disallowances.

C. FIXED RATES WITH CARRY-FORWARD PROVISIONS:  The fixed rates
contained in this agreement are based on estimates of the costs
for FY 1999. When actual costs for this fiscal year are
determined, adjustments will be applied to the next subsequent
rate negotiation to recognize the difference between the
FY 1999 estimated costs used to establish the fixed rates and
the negotiated actual FY 1999 costs. 

D. PREDETERMINED RATES:  The predetermined rates contained in this
agreement are not subject to adjustment in accordance with the
provisions of OMB Circular A-21, subject to the limitations
contained in Part A of this section. 

E. CARRY-FORWARD AMOUNTS:

F. APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DoD CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS:
In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless waived by 
the institution) may be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise
allowable indirect costs incurred by an institution of higher
education under a DOD contract awarded on or after 
November 30, 1993, unless the same limitation is applied
uniformally to all other organizations performing similar work.
It has been determined by the Department of Defense that such
limitation is not being uniformally applied.  Accordingly, 
the rates cited (2) of Section I, as explained under the title
"APPLICABLE TO" (2), do not reflect the application of the 26%
limitation on administrative indirect costs imposed by OMB
Circular A-21 where as (1) does so.

G. USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in
Section I hereof were negotiated in accordance with and under
the authority set forth in OMB Circular A-21.  Accordingly,
such rates shall be applied to the extent provided in such
circular to grants and contracts to which OMB Circular A-21 
is applicable, subject to any limitations in part A of this
section. Copies of this document may be provided by either
party to other Federal agencies which have or intend to
issue or award grants and contracts using these rates or to
otherwise provide such agencies with documentary notice of
this agreement and its terms and conditions.
