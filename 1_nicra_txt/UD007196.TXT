ONR Indirect Cost Rate Agreement dated 4 October 1995 established
fixed rates with carryforward provisions for Massachusetts Institute
Of Technology (MIT) for fiscal year ending 30 June 1996.

10 February 1997,  and DCAA Audit Report No. 2177-97G10150001
dated 30 June 1997.  These rates have been determined in
accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21.

                           SPECIAL REMARKS

     1.  ONR letter of 17 August 1982 approving treatment of tuition
remission was considered in establishing these actual rates.

     2.  The actual rates contained in this agreement are based, in
part, on the institution's cost allocation special study for utility
costs and an alternate allocation base for library costs.  The
Government has not accepted the methodology or results of this special
study or alternate allocation base, but has agreed to partially
utilize the results of the study and alternate allocation base as a
basis for negotiating the university's FY96 actual indirect cost rates.
Use of such methodologies is on a non-precedent setting basis, and
does not imply Government acceptance of the results of the utility
cost allocation special study or the library cost alternate
allocation base in this or any other indirect cost rate negotiation.

     3.  The facilities and administrative cost pool amounts used to
establish the actual facilities and administrative cost rates set
forth herein include reinstated amounts of $216,930 (On Campus) and
$44,352 (Off Campus) in accordance with OMB Circular A-21, Section
C.9.b.  These reinstated amounts represent unallowable costs which
the Government included in the calculation of a cash payment due the
Government per OMB Circular A-21, Section C.8, and have been
reinstated to avoid duplicate recovery of the unallowable costs
by the Government.

Please indicate your acceptance of the FY96 actual rates and
carryforward adjustments by signature in the space provided below.
The terms of this negotiation agreement are subject to all
regulations and statutes applicable to any contract, grant, or other
agreement including the provisions of OMB Circular A-21.  The terms
of this negotiation agreement will not change any monetary ceilings of
any individual Federal contract, grant, or other agreement with MIT.
