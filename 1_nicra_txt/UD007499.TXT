SECTION II: GENERAL

A.  LIMITATIONS: Use of the rates contained in this Agreement is
subject to any statutory or administrative limitations and is 
applicable  to a given grant or contract only to the extent that 
funds are available.   Acceptance of the rates agreed to herein is
predicated upon  the following conditions:  (1) that no costs other
than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in this
indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that such costs are legal
obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under governing
cost principles: (2) that the same costs that have been treated as
indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar
types of costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment;
and (4) that the information provided by the grantee/contractor which
was used  as a basis for acceptance of the rates agreed to herein is
not subsequently found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The fixed rates contained in this Agreement
are based on the accounting system in effect at the time the agreement
was negotiated.  Changes to the method of accounting for costs which
affect the amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of these
rates require the prior approval of the authorized representative of
the cognizant negotiation agency.  Such changes include, but are not
limited to changes in the charging of a particular type of cost from
indirect to direct.   Failure to obtain such approval may result in
subsequent cost disallowances.

C.  FIXED RATES:  Each fixed rate in this agreement is based on an
estimate of the costs for the period covered by the rate.  When actual
costs for this period are determined, an adjustment may be made to a
rate of a future year to recognize the difference between the
estimated costs used to establish the fixed rate and the negotiated
actual costs.

D.  PREDETERMINED RATES:  The predetermined rates contained in this
agreement are not subject to adjustment in accordance with the
provisions of OMB Circular A-21, subject to the limitations contained
in Part A of this Section.

E.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The fixed rates contained herein
were negotiated in accordance with the authority set forth in OMB
Circular A-21, and should be applied to grants and contracts to which
OMB Circular A-21 applies, subject to any limitations in paragraph A.
above.  Copies of this document may be provided by the Institution to
other Federal Agencies having grants and contracts using these rates
as a means of providing them with early notification of the agreement
contained herein.

F.  APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DOD CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS

In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless waived by the
institution) may be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable
indirect costs incurred by an institution of higher education under a
DoD contract awarded on or after November 30, 1993, unless the same
limitation is applied uniformly to all other organizations performing
similar work.  It has been determined by the Department of Defense that
such limitation is not being uniformly applied.  Accordingly, the rates
cited (1) of Section I, as explained under title "APPLICABLE TO" (1),
do not reflect the application of the 26% limitation on administrative
indirect costs imposed by OMB A-21, whereas (2) does so.

G.   LIQUIDATION OF PRIOR YEAR CARRYFORWARD AMOUNTS

     1.   F&A Rates

          The F&A rates set forth herein include no adjustments for the
          liquidation of any prior years' estimated carryforward
          amounts.

     2.   Fringe Benefit Rates     

          The university had a Fringe Benefit overrecovery of $578,970 
          in FY97.  $42,350 of the $578,970 overrecovery was
          liquidated through an adjustment to the FY98 Fringe Benefit
          rate.  The FY99 Fringe Benefit rate of 24.50% set forth
          herein includes the liquidation of the remaining $536,620
          of the $578,970 overrecovery carryforward amount.

H.   QUALIFICATIONS; The parties have agreed to these fixed rates with
     the following understandings:

     1.  The F&A indirect cost pool used to generate the F&A cost rates
         contained in this agreement includes Account #8272 repair and
         maintenance costs that were allocated to organized research on
         the basis of departmental square footage ratios.  It is hereby
         agreed that beginning 1 July 1998, the university will
         accumulate the actual Account #8272 repair and maintenance
         cost allocations to organized research on the basis of
         building square footage ratios instead of departmental square
         footage ratios.

     2.  The purpose of this agreement is to establish fixed F&A cost
         rates and fixed/predetermined Fringe Benefit rates for the
         period 1 July 1998 through 30 June 1999.  Rates established
         in Section I above are based on Carnegie Mellon University's
         proposal dated 15 January 1998, and the establishment of
         these rates by the Government, based on the accounting
         systems and allocation methodologies contained in this
         proposal, does not represent an agreement that these
         systems and methodologies are accepted for FY99, or for
         any subsequent fiscal year's rate negotiation.  The 
         recommendations of the Defense Contract Audit Agency,
         Pittsburgh Branch in Audit Report No. 6381-98C23000001 were
         considered during the negotiation of these rates.
