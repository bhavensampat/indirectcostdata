ONR Indirect Cost Rate Agreement dated 16 March 1994 established fixed
rates with carryforward provisions for Carnegie Mellon University for
fiscal year ending 30 June 1994.

The purpose of this negotiation agreement is to record agreement on
the carryforward amounts resulting from determination of actual
costs for FY 1994 (FY94).

The rates listed below are based on Carnegie Mellon University's
FY94 actual indirect cost rates proposal dated 31 January 1995 and
DCAA Audit Report No. 6381-95C10150003 dated 13 March 1996.  These
rates have been determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB
Circular A-21.

     subgrants and subcontracts up to $25,000 each, and excluding
     50% of graduate student compensation regarded as tuition
     remission.
                                         

          
                      Carryforwards

The carryforward amounts resulting from establishment of FY 94
actual costs are as follows:

                         FY94 Carryforward
Rate Category            Amount  ($000's)           
                     
Onsite Overhead          $4,996 (O)
                                                     
Offsite Overhead         $    3 (O)

SEI                      $  257 (U)

(O)  Designates Overrecovery          (U)  Designates Underrecovery

The FY 94 negotiated carryforward amounts shown above will be
liquidated through adjustments to future years' fixed, predetermined,
or postdetermined rates.  The carryforward amounts from several
prior fiscal years have not yet been determined, due to the recent
DCIS investigation at Carnegie Mellon University, which continued
from 1993 until 1997.  When Carnegie Mellon University and the
Government have negotiated each rate category's under/overrecovery
carryforward amounts from these prior fiscal years, it is intended to
combine them with the above FY 94 carryforward amounts for each rate
category, and credit the cumulative totals with the several
carryforward liquidation adjustments that have already been made to
certain years' fixed rates.  The remaining unliquidated carryforward
balances for each rate category will then be scheduled for liquidation
through adjustments to future years' fixed, predetermined, or
postdetermined rates.  Details of this carryforward liquidation
methodology will be displayed in a comprehensive matrix which will be
included in a future final indirect cost rate agreement.

                          Special Remarks

The parties have agreed to the actual rates set forth above with the
following understanding:

The purpose of this agreement is to establish actual F&A rates for
the period 1 July 1993 through 30 June 1994.  Rates established in
Section I above are based on Carnegie Mellon University's proposal
dated 31 January 1995, and the establishment of these rates by the
Government, based on the accounting systems and allocation
methodologies contained in this proposal, does not represent an
agreement that these systems and methodologies are accepted for FY94,
or for any subsequent fiscal year's rate negotiation.  The
recommendations of the Defense Contract Audit Agency, Pittsburgh
Branch in Audit Report No. 6381- 95C10150003 were considered during
the negotiation of these rates.  

Please indicate your acceptance of the FY94 actual rates and
carryforward adjustments by signature in the space provided below.
The terms of this negotiation agreement are subject to all
regulations and statutes applicable to any contract, grant, or other
agreement including the provisions of OMB Circular A-21.  The terms
of this negotiation agreement will not change any monetary ceilings
of any individual Federal contract, grant, or other agreement with
Carnegie Mellon University.
