                        APPLICABLE TO

          (1)  Applies to all DoD contracts awarded before
November 30, 1993, all Non-DoD Instruments, and all DoD Grants.

          (2)  Applies only to DoD contracts awarded on or after
November 30, 1993 in accordance with and under the authority of
DFARS 231.303(1).  See Section II, Part C, hereof.  

SECTION II - GENERAL                                                    

A.   LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I
is subject to any statutory or administrative limitations and
is applicable to a given grant or contract only to the extent
that funds are available.  Acceptance of the rates agreed to
herein is predicated upon all of the following conditions: (1)
that no costs other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor
were included in this indirect cost pool as finally accepted and
that such costs are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor
and allowable under governing cost principles, (2) that the same
costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed
as direct costs, (3) that similar types of costs have been
accorded consistent accounting treatment, and (4) that the
information provided by the grantee/contractor which was used
as a basis for acceptance of the rates agreed to herein, and
expressly relied upon by the Government in negotiating and
accepting the said rates is not subsequently found to be
materially incomplete or inaccurate.          

B.   ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The rates contained in Section I
of this agreement are based on the accounting system in effect
at the time the agreement was negotiated.  Changes to the
method(s) of accounting for costs which affect the amount of
reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates require
the prior approval of the authorized representative of the
cognizant negotiation agency.  Such changes include but are
not limited to changes in the charging of a particular type
of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure to obtain such
approval may result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C.   APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DoD
CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS:  In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no
limitation (unless waived by the institution) may be placed on
the reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs
incurred by an institution of higher education under a DOD
contract awarded on or after November 30, 1993, unless the
same limitation is applied uniformly to all other organizations
performing similar work.  It has been determined by the
Department of Defense that such limitation is not being
uniformly applied.  Accordingly, the rates cited (2) of Section
I, as explained under the title "APPLICABLE TO" do not reflect
the application of the 26% limitation on administrative
indirect costs imposed by OMB Circular A-21 whereas (1) does so.

D.   USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in
Section I were negotiated in accordance with and under the
authority set forth in OMB Circular A-21.  Accordingly, such
rates shall be applied to the extent provided in such Circular
to grants and contracts to which OMB Circular A-21 applies,
subject to any limitations in part A of this section.  Copies
of this document may be provided by either party to other
federal agencies which have or intend to issue or award
sponsored agreements using these rates or to otherwise provide
such agencies with documentary notice of this agreement and
its terms and conditions.

E.   FIXED RATES WITH CARRYFORWARD PROVISIONS:   

     1.   This type of rate is considered final and not
subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions
of OMB Circular A-21 and the Federal Acquisition Regulation,
subject to the limitations contained in Part A of this
Section; except that the difference between the estimated
costs and the actual costs of the period covered by the rate
is carried forward as an adjustment to the rate computation
of a subsequent period as discussed below.

     2.   The FY99 rates contained in this agreement are based
on estimates of the costs for FY99.  When actual costs for this
period are determined, adjustments will be applied to the next
subsequent rate negotiation to compensate for the difference
between the estimated FY99 costs used to establish the fixed
rates with carryforward provisions and the negotiated actual
FY99 costs.

F.   PREDETERMINED RATES:  The predetermined rates contained
in this agreement are not subject to adjustment in accordance
with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21, subject to the
limitations contained in Part A of this Section.

G.   LIQUIDATION OF PRIOR YEAR CARRYFORWARD AMOUNTS: Shown
below are the estimated FY97 carryforward amounts that are
being liquidated through the FY99 fixed
rates set forth above:

             RESIDENT INSTRUCTION: ORGANIZED RESEARCH

purpose of calculating any FY97 remaining unliquidated
carryforward balance.

                     FRINGE BENEFITS

1.   The FY 99 "Full Fringe Benefit" rate set forth above
includes the liquidation of an estimated $18,000 overrecovery
amount from FY 97.  The FY 97 estimated carryforward amount
liquidated herein will be credited against the FY97 negotiated
final total carryforward amount for the purpose of calculating
any FY97 remaining unliquidated carryforward balance.

2.   The FY 99 "Partial Fringe Benefit" rate set forth above
includes the liquidation of an estimated $5,000 overrecovery
amount from FY 97.  The FY 97 estimated carryforward amount
liquidated herein will be credited against the FY97 negotiated
final total carryforward amount for the purpose of calculating
any FY97 remaining unliquidated carryforward balance.

H.   SPECIAL REMARKS: The purpose of this agreement is to
establish fixed F&A rates with carryforward provisions, and
predetermined rates for the period 1 July 1998 through
30 June 1999.  These rates are based on GIT/GTRC's proposal
dated 29 April 1998 and the establishment of these rates by
the Government based on the accounting systems and allocation
methodologies contained in this proposal does not represent
an agreement that these systems and methodologies are accepted
for fiscal year 1999, or for any subsequent year's rate
negotiation.  The recommendations of the Defense Contract
Audit Agency, Atlanta Branch in Audit Reports # 1101-98T23000002
and #1101-98T2300004 were considered in the negotiation of these
rates.
