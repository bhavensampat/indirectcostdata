The rates listed below are based on MIT's FY97 actual Facilities
And Administrative (Indirect) cost rates proposal dated
29 April 1998,  and DCAA Audit Report No. 2171-98G10150001 dated
23 July 1998.  These rates have been determined in accordance
with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21.

                         SPECIAL REMARKS

     1.  ONR letter of 17 August 1982 approving treatment of tuition
remission was considered in establishing these actual rates.

     2.  The actual rates contained in this agreement are based, in
part, on the institution's cost allocation special study for utility
costs and an alternate allocation base for library costs.  The
Government has not accepted the methodology or results of this
special study or alternate allocation base, but has agreed to
partially utilize the results of the study and alternate allocation
base as a basis for negotiating the university's FY97 actual indirect
cost rates.  Use of such methodologies is on a non-precedent setting
basis, and does not imply Government acceptance of the results of the
utility cost allocation special study or the library cost alternate
allocation base in this or any other indirect cost rate negotiation.

Please indicate your acceptance of the FY97 actual rates and carry-
forward adjustments by signature in the space provided below.
The terms of this negotiation agreement are subject to all
regulations and statutes applicable to any contract, grant, or other
agreement including the provisions of OMB Circular A-21.  The terms
of this negotiation agreement will not change any monetary ceilings
of any individual Federal contract, grant, or other agreement with
MIT.
