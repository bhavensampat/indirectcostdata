                            CARRYFORWARDS

The carryforward amounts resulting from establishment of FY 97
actual costs are as follows:
                                                                                                    
               Resident Instruction (Rounded To $000's)

$ 797,000 (O)  - FY 97 Total C/F Amount
  355,000 (O)  - Estimated FY 97 C/F Amount Liquidated Through
                 FY98 Fixed Rate
  628,000 (O)  - Estimated FY 97 C/F Amount Liquidated Through
                 FY 99 Provisional Rate
$ 186,000 (U)  - FY 97 C/F Balance 

The unliquidated underrecovery carryforward balance of $186,000
shown above will be liquidated during a future fixed or
predetermined rates negotiation.  In the event that GIT/GTRC
changes to the use of postdetermined rates, the above
unliquidated carryforward balance will be liquidated as part of
the next postdetermined rates negotiation.

                                                 
              GTRI (On & Off Campus); (Rounded To $000's)

$1,191,000 (O)  - FY 97 Total C/F Amount
 1,154,000 (O)  - Estimated FY 97 C/F Amount Liquidated Through
                  FY 99 Provisional G&A Rate
$   37,000 (O)  - FY 97 C/F Balance To Be Liquidated Through Future
                  Year's G&A Rate

The FY 97 GTRI carryforward amount shown above was determined in
accordance with the requirements of OMB Circular A-21.  Effective
with FY 99, GTRI's recovery of direct and indirect costs will be
governed by the cost principles set forth in FAR Section 31.2.
The expected ratio of Government sponsored activities to non-
Government sponsored activities in GTRI's G&A allocation base will
be approximately the same as the corresponding ratio was in its
previous MTDC base.  Therefore, the unliquidated overrecovery
balance of $37,000 shown above will be liquidated by means of an
adjustment to a future GTRI G&A rate.

                     SPECIAL REMARKS

APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DOD CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS:
In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless waived by
the institution) may be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise
allowable indirect costs incurred by an institution of higher
education under a DOD contract awarded on or after November 30, 1993,
unless the same limitation is applied uniformly to all other
organizations performing similar work.  It has been determined by
the Department of Defense that such limitation is not being
uniformly applied.  Accordingly, the rates cited (2) of Section I,
as explained under the title "APPLICABLE TO" do not reflect the
application of the 26% limitation on administrative indirect costs
imposed by OMB Circular A-21 whereas (1) does so.


Please indicate your acceptance of the FY 97 actual rates and
carryforward adjustments by signature in the space provided below.
The terms of this negotiation agreement are subject to all
regulations and statutes applicable to any contract, grant, or
other agreement including the provisions of OMB Circular A-21.
The terms of this negotiation agreement will not change any
monetary ceilings of any individual Federal contract, grant, or
other agreement with GIT/GTRC.
