                           APPLICABLE TO

(1)  Applies to DOD contracts awarded before November 30, 1993,
all Non-DOD Instruments, and all DOD Grants.

(2)  Applies to only DOD contracts awarded on or after
November 30, 1993 in accordance with and under the authority of
DFARS 231.303(1).  See Section II, Part G.2. hereof.

SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

A.   LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is
subject to any statutory or administrative limitations and is
applicable to a given grant, contract or other agreement only to
the extent that funds are available and consistent with any and
all limitations of cost clauses or provisions, if any, contained
therein.  Acceptance of the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon
all of the following conditions: (1) that no costs other than those
incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in this indirect
cost pool as finally accepted and that such costs are legal
obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under governing
cost principles; (2) that the same costs that have been treated as
indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar
types of costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment;
and (4) that the information provided by the grantee/contractor,
which was used as the basis for acceptance of the rates agreed to
herein and expressly relied upon by the Government in negotiating
and accepting the said rates, is not subsequently found to be
materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.   ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The rates contained in Section I of this
agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at the time
the agreement was negotiated.  Changes to the method(s) of accounting
for costs which affect the amount of reimbursement resulting from the
use of these rates require the written approval of the authorized
representative of the cognizant negotiating agency for the Government
prior to implementation of any such changes.  Such changes include but
are not limited to changes in the charging of a particular type of
costs from indirect to direct.  Failure to obtain such approval may
result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C.   FIXED RATES: The fixed rates contained in this agreement are
based on estimates of the costs for FY 1999.  When actual costs for
FY 1999 are determined, adjustments will be applied to the next
subsequent rate negotiation to recognize the difference between the
FY 1999 estimated costs used to establish the fixed rates and the
negotiated actual FY 1999 costs.  

D.   CARRY-FORWARD AMOUNTS: The rates set forth in Section I are
inclusive of  FY 1996 carry-forward amounts, as established by
Negotiation Agreement for FY 1996 Final Rates and Carry-forwards
dated July 17, 1998.  The FY 1996 carry-forward amounts are
liquidated in their entirety.

E.   USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in
Section I hereof were negotiated in accordance with and under the
authority set forth in OMB Circular A-21.  Accordingly, such rates
shall be applied to the extent provided in such circular to grants
and contracts to which OMB Circular A-21 is applicable, subject to
any limitations in part A of this section.  Copies of this document
may be provided by either party to other Federal agencies which
have or intend to issue or award grants and contracts using these
rates or otherwise provide such agencies with documentary notice
of this agreement and its terms and conditions.

F.   SPECIAL REMARKS:  NM Tech uses off-campus rates on projects
for which ninety (90%) or more of the expense will be incurred
at a location which is beyond the area maintained by components
of the operations maintenance organizational units and costs.

G.    APPLICATION OF FACILITY & ADMINISTRATIVE COST RATES TO DoD
CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS:  

     1.  Signature of this agreement by the authorized representatives
of New Mexico Institute of Mining & Technology and the Government,
acknowledges and affirms the institution's request for waiver of the
prohibition contained in DFARS 231.303(1) and the Government's
exercise of its discretion under DFARS 231.303(2) to waive the
prohibition in DFARS 231.303(1) for only the Facilities and
Administrative cost rates applicable to the Main Campus.   The waiver
request by New Mexico Institute of Mining & Technology is made to
simplify the institute's overall management of DOD cost
reimbursements under DOD contracts.

     2.  In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless
waived by the institution, see paragraph G.1. above) may be placed
on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred
by an institution of higher education under a DOD contract awarded
on or after November 30, 1993, unless the same limitation is applied
uniformly to all other organizations performing similar work.  It has
been determined by the Department of Defense that such limitation is
not being uniformly applied.  Accordingly, the rates cited (2) of
Section I, as explained under the title "APPLICABLE TO", do not
reflect the application of the 26% limitation on administrative
indirect costs imposed by OMB Circular A-21 where as (1) does.
