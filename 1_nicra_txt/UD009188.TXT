(O)  Designates Overrecovery    (U)  Designates Underrecovery

The FY 88 negotiated carry forward amounts shown above will be
liquidated through adjustments to future years' fixed,
predetermined, or postdetermined rates.  The carryforward amounts
from several fiscal years have not yet been determined, due to the
DCIS investigation at Carnegie Mellon University which took place
from 1993 until 1997.  When Carnegie Mellon University and the
Government have negotiated each rate category's under/
overrecovery carryforward amounts from these prior fiscal years,
it is intended to combine them with the above FY 88 carryforward
amounts for each rate category, and credit the cumulative totals
with the several carryforward liquidation adjustments that have
already been made to certain years' fixed rates.  The remaining
unliquidated carryforward balances for each rate category will
then be scheduled for liquidation through adjustments to future
years' fixed, predetermined, or postdetermined rates.  Details of
this carryforward liquidation methodology will be displayed in a
comprehensive matrix which will be included in a future final
indirect cost rate agreement.

B.   Qualification; The parties have agreed to the actual rates set
forth above with the following understandings:

      "The purpose of this agreement is to establish actual F&A
rates for the period 1 July 1987 through 30 June 1988.  Rates
established in Section I above are based on Carnegie Mellon
University's proposal dated 16 July 1991, and the
establishment of these rates by the Government, based on the
accounting systems and allocation methodologies contained in
this proposal, does not represent an agreement that these
systems and methodologies are accepted for FY 88,  or for       
any subsequent fiscal year's rate negotiation.  The
recommendations of the Defense Contract Audit Agency,
Pittsburgh Branch in Audit Report No. 6381- 91C14010004S2,
dated 8 December 1993 were considered during the negotiation
of these rates."

other agreement with Carnegie Mellon University.
