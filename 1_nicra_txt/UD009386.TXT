ONR Indirect Cost Rate Agreement dated 11 June 1984 and the
Memorandum of Understanding dated 13 December 1984 established
fixed rates with carryforward provisions for Carnegie Mellon
University for fiscal year ending 30 June 1986.

The purpose of this Negotiation Agreement is to record

determination of actual costs for FY 1986  (FY86).

The actual rates listed below are based on Carnegie
Mellon University's  FY 86 actual Indirect Cost Rates revised
proposal dated 16 June 1989 and DCAA Audit Report
No. 6381-90C14010002-S2 dated 2 December 1993.  These rates have
been determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular
A-21.

SECTION II:
    
A.  Carry Forwards:  The carryforward amounts resulting from
    establishment of FY 86 actual costs are as follows:

                         FY 86 Carryforward
Rate Category            Amount  ($000's)

(O)  Designates Overrecovery          (U)  Designates Underrecovery

The FY 86 negotiated carry forward amounts shown above will be
liquidated through adjustments to future years' fixed,
predetermined, or postdetermined rates.  The carryforward amounts
from several  fiscal years have not yet been determined, due to
the DCIS investigation at Carnegie Mellon University which took
place from 1993 until 1997.  When Carnegie Mellon University and
the Government have negotiated each rate category's under/
overrecovery carryforward amounts from these prior fiscal years,
it is intended to combine them with the above FY 86 carryforward
amounts for each rate category, and credit the cumulative totals
with the several carryforward liquidation adjustments that have
already been made to certain years' fixed rates.  The remaining
unliquidated carryforward balances for each rate category will
then be scheduled for liquidation through adjustments to future
years' fixed, predetermined, or postdetermined rates.  Details of
this carryforward liquidation methodology will be displayed in a
comprehensive matrix which will be included in a future final
indirect cost rate agreement.

B.   Qualification; The parties have agreed to the actual rates
set forth above with the following understandings:

      "The purpose of this agreement is to establish actual F&A
rates for the period 1 July 1985 through 30 June 1986.  Rates
established in Section I above are based on Carnegie Mellon
University's proposal dated 16 June 1989, and the establishment
of these rates by the Government, based on the accounting systems
and allocation methodologies contained in this proposal, does not
represent an agreement that these systems and methodologies are
accepted for FY 86,  or for any subsequent fiscal year's rate
negotiation.  The recommendations of the Defense  Contract Audit
Agency, Pittsburgh Branch in Audit Report No. 6381-90C14010002-S2,
dated 2 December 1993 were considered during the negotiation of
these rates." 

Please indicate your acceptance of the FY 86 actual rates and
carryforward adjustments by signature in the space provided below.

regulations and statutes applicable to any contract, grant, or
other agreement including the provisions of OMB Circular A-21.

monetary ceilings of any individual Federal contract, grant, or
other agreement with Carnegie Mellon University.
