                            SPECIAL REMARKS

APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DOD CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS: 
In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless waived by
the institution) may be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise
allowable indirect costs incurred by an institution of higher
education under a DOD contract awarded on or after November 30,
1993, unless the same limitation is applied uniformly to all other
organizations performing similar work.  It has been determined by
the Department of Defense that such limitation is not being
uniformly applied.  Accordingly, the rates cited (2) of Section I,
as explained under the title "APPLICABLE TO" do not reflect the
application of the 26% limitation on administrative indirect costs
imposed by OMB Circular A-21 whereas (1) does so.

Please indicate your acceptance of the FY 97 actual rates and
carryforward adjustments by signature in the space provided below.
The terms of this negotiation agreement are subject to all
regulations and statutes applicable to any contract, grant, or
other agreement including the provisions of OMB Circular A-21.
The terms of this negotiation agreement will not change any
monetary ceilings of any individual Federal contract, grant, or
other agreement with The Pennsylvania State University.
