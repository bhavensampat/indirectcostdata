Grants.

          (2)  Applies only to DoD contracts awarded on or
after November 30, 1993 in accordance with and under the
authority of DFARS 231.303(1).  See Special Remarks below.  

                           CARRYFORWARDS

The carry forward amounts resulting from establishment 
of FY 98 actual costs are as follows:

Resident Instruction (Capped & Uncapped) 
  
Total  FY98 C/F Amount                   $ 828,375  (O)

Plus:  Prior Year Overrecovery 
       Liquidated in FY 1998 Fixed Rates    56,000  (O)

Balance FY98 C/F to be Liquidated in 
Future Rates                             $ 884,375  (O)

The over recovery carry forward balances shown above will 
be liquidated during a future fixed or predetermined rates
negotiation.  In the event that GIT/GTRC changes to the
use of postdetermined rates, the above unliquidated
carry forward balance will be liquidated as part of the next
postdetermined rates negotiation.
                                                   
GTRI (On & Off Campus) (Capped & Uncapped)

Total  FY98 C/F Amount                    $ 3,739,056 (U)

Less:  Prior Year Overrecovery 
       Liquidated in FY 1998 Fixed Rates    1,792,903 (O)

Balance FY98 C/F to be Liquidated
in Future Rates                           $ 1,946,154 (U)

The  FY98 GTRI carry forward amount shown above was
determined in accordance with the requirements of OMB
Circular A-21.  Effective with FY 99, GTRI's recovery of
direct and indirect costs will be governed by the cost
principles set forth in FAR Section 31.2.  The expected
ratio of Government sponsored activities to non-Government
sponsored activities in GTRI's G&A allocation base will be
approximately the same as the corresponding ratio was in
its previous MTDC base. Therefore, the unliquidated carry
forward  balances shown above will be liquidated by means
of an adjustment to a future GTRI rate.

                      SPECIAL REMARKS

APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DOD CONTRACTS/
SUBCONTRACTS: In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no 
limitation (unless waived by the institution) may be
placed on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable
indirect costs incurred by an institution of higher
education under a DOD contract awarded on or after 
November 30, 1993, unless the same limitation
is applied uniformly to all other organizations 
performing similar work.  It has been determined by
the Department of Defense that such limitation is not 
being uniformly applied.  Accordingly, the rates cited
(2) of Section I, as explained under the title
"APPLICABLE TO" do not reflect the application of the 26%
limitation on administrative indirect costs imposed by OMB
Circular A-21 whereas (1) does so.

Please indicate your acceptance of the FY 98 actual rates
and carry forward adjustments by signature in the space
provided below.  The terms of this negotiation agreement are
subject to all regulations and statutes applicable to any
contract, grant, or other agreement including the provisions
of OMB Circular A-21.  The terms of this negotiation agreement
will not change any monetary ceilings of any individual Federal
contract, grant, or other agreement with GIT/GTRC.
