SECTION II - GENERAL                                                    
                                                                                                                                                       
A.   LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is
subject to any statutory or administrative limitations and is
applicable to a given grant or contract only to the extent that
funds are available.  Acceptance of the rates agreed to herein
is predicated upon all of the following conditions: (1) that no
costs other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were
included in the above indirect cost pools as finally accepted
and that such costs are legal obligations of the grantee/
contractor and allowable under governing cost principles,
(2) that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs
are not claimed as direct costs, (3) that similar types of costs
have been accorded consistent accounting treatment, and (4) that
the information provided by the grantee/contractor which was used
as a basis for acceptance of the rates agreed to herein, and
expressly relied upon by the Government in negotiating and
accepting the said rates is not subsequently found to be
materially incomplete or inaccurate.     
    
B.   ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The rates contained in Section I of
this agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at
the time the agreement was negotiated.  Changes to the method(s)
of accounting for costs which affect the amount of reimbursement
resulting from the use of these rates require the prior approval
of the authorized representative of the cognizant negotiation
agency.  Such changes include but are not limited to changes in
the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to
direct.  Failure to obtain such approval may result in
subsequent cost disallowances.

C.   USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth
in Section I were negotiated in accordance with and under
the authority set forth in OMB Circular A-122 and the
FAR. Accordingly, such rates shall be applied to the extent
provided in OMB Circular A-122 and the FAR to grants and
contracts to which OMB Circular A-122 and the FAR apply,
subject to any limitations in part A of this section.
Copies of this document may be provided by either
party to other federal agencies which have or intend to
issue or award sponsored agreements using these rates or
to otherwise provide such agencies with documentary
notice of this agreement and its terms and conditions.

D.   LIQUIDATION OF PRIOR YEAR CARRYFORWARD AMOUNTS: 
Shown below are the prior year carryforward amounts
that are being liquidated through the FY99 provisional
rates set forth above.

                 FRINGE BENEFITS
1.  The FY99 "Full Fringe Benefit" rate set forth
above includes the liquidation of an estimated $18,000
overrecovery amount from FY 97.  The FY97 estimated
carryforward amount liquidated herein will be credited
against the FY97 negotiated final total carryforward
amount for the purpose of calculating any FY97
remaining unliquidated carryforward balance.

2. The FY99 "Partial Fringe Benefit" rate set forth
above includes the liquidation of an estimated $5,000
overrecovery amount from FY97.  The FY97 estimated
carryforward amount liquidated herein will be credited
against the FY97 negotiated final total carryforward
amount for the purpose of calculating any FY97
remaining unliquidated carryforward balance.

(O)  Denotes Overrecovery

The prior year carryforwards shown in the above table
resulted from fiscal years in which GTRI's fixed
overhead rates and carryforward amounts were
determined in accordance with the requirements of
OMB Circular A-21. The fixed rates and carryforward
amounts for FY98 are also being determined in
accordance with the requirements of OMB Circular A-21.
Effective with FY99, GTRI's recovery of direct and
indirect costs (indicated by the rates shown in
Section I above) will be governed by the cost
principles set forth at FAR Section 31.2.  The
expected ratio of Government sponsored activities to
non-Government sponsored activities in GTRI's G&A
allocation base will be approximately the same as
the corresponding ratio in its previous MTDC bases.
Therefore, all remaining prior year carryforward
amounts that were or will be determined in
accordance with OMB Circular A-21 will be liquidated
by means of adjustments to GTRI's  FY99 and future
G&A rates.

E.   SPECIAL REMARKS: The purpose of this agreement
is to establish provisional indirect cost, fringe
benefits and cost of money rates for the period
1 July 1998 through 30 June 1999.  The establishment
of these rates by the Government based on the
accounting systems and allocation methodologies in
effect at the time this rate agreement is signed
does not represent an agreement that these systems
and methodologies are accepted for fiscal year 1999,
or for any subsequent year's rate negotiation.
