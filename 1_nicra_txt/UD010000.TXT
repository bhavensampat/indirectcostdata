A.   LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I
is subject to any statutory or administrative limitations and is
applicable to a given grant or contract only to the extent that
funds are available.  Acceptance of the rates agreed to herein
is predicated upon all of the following conditions: (1) that no
costs other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were
included in this indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that
such costs are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and
allowable under governing cost principles, (2) that the same
costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed
as direct costs, (3) that similar types of costs have been
accorded consistent accounting treatment, and (4) that the
information provided by the grantee/contractor which was used
as a basis for acceptance of the rates agreed to herein, and
expressly relied upon by the Government in negotiating and
accepting the said rates is not subsequently found to be
materially incomplete or inaccurate.          

B.   ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The fixed rates contained in
Section I of this agreement are based on the accounting
system in effect at the time the agreement was negotiated.
 Changes to the method(s) of accounting for costs which
affect the amount of reimbursement resulting from the use
of these rates require the prior approval of the authorized
representative of the cognizant negotiation agency.  Such
changes include but are not limited to changes in the
charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to
direct.  Failure to obtain such approval may result in
subsequent cost disallowances.

C.   USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth
in Section I were negotiated in accordance with and under
the authority contained in OMB Circular A-21.  Accordingly,
such rates shall be applied to the extent provided in such
Circular to grants and contracts to which OMB Circular A-21
applies, subject to any limitations in part A of this
section.  Copies of this document may be provided by either
party to other federal agencies which have or intend to
issue or award sponsored agreements using these rates or
to otherwise provide such agencies with documentary notice
of this agreement and its terms and conditions.

D.   FIXED RATES:  The fixed rates in this agreement are
based on estimates of the costs for FY 2000.  When actual
costs for the period is determined, an adjustment will be
made to the rates of a future year to recognize the
difference between the FY 2000 estimated costs used to
establish the fixed rates and the negotiated actual
FY 2000 costs.  The fixed rates in this agreement are
based on estimates of the costs for FY 2001.  When actual
costs for the period is determined, an adjustment will
be made to the rates of a future year to recognize the
difference between the FY 2001 estimated costs used to
establish the fixed rates and the negotiated actual
FY 2001 costs.

F.   SPECIAL REMARKS: 

     1.  Off Campus rates are used when the preponderance of
effort is performed at Lincoln Laboratory, Haystack
Observatory or other off-site locations.
     
     2.  The fixed rates contained in this agreement are based,
in part, on the institution's alternate allocation base for
library costs.  The Government has not accepted the methodology
or results of this alternate allocation base, but has agreed to
partially utilize the alternate allocation base as a basis for
negotiating the university's FY00 and FY01 fixed F&A cost rates.
Use of this methodology is on a non-precedent setting basis, and
does not imply Government acceptance of the library cost
alternate allocation base in this or any other indirect cost
rate negotiation.

     3.  The purpose of this agreement is to establish fixed F&A
cost rates for the period 1 July 1999 through 30 June 2001.
These rates are based on MIT's proposal dated 12 January 1999,
and the establishment of these rates by the Government based on
the accounting systems and allocation methodologies contained in
this proposal does not represent an agreement that these systems
and methodologies are accepted for fiscal year 2000, 2001, or for
any subsequent year's rate negotiation. 

     4.  Signature of this agreement by the authorized
representatives of MIT and the Government acknowledges and
affirms the Institute's request for waiver of the prohibition
contained in DFARS 231.303 (1) and the Government's exercise of
its discretion contained in DFARS 231.303 (2) to waive the
prohibition in DFARS 231.303 (1).  The waiver request by MIT is
made to simplify the Institute's overall management of DOD cost
reimbursement under DOD contracts.
