SECTION II - GENERAL                                                    

A.   LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section
I is subject to any statutory or administrative limitations
and is applicable to a given grant or contract only to the
extent that funds are available.  Acceptance of the rates
agreed to herein is predicated upon  the following
conditions: (1) that no costs other than those incurred by
the grantee/contractor were included in this indirect cost
pool as finally accepted and that such costs are legal
obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under
governing cost principles; (2) that the same costs that
have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as
direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs have been
accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) that
the information provided by the grantee/contractor which
was used as a basis for acceptance of the rates agreed to
herein, and expressly relied upon by the Government in
negotiating and accepting the said rates is not
subsequently found to be materially incomplete
or inaccurate.          

B.   ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The rates contained in Section I
of this agreement are based on the accounting system in
effect at the time the agreement was negotiated.  Changes
to the method(s) of accounting for costs which affect the
amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of these
rates require the prior approval of the authorized
representative of the cognizant negotiation agency.  Such
changes include but are not limited to changes in the
charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to
direct.  Failure to obtain such approval may result in
subsequent cost disallowances.

C.   USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth
in Section I were negotiated in accordance with and under
the authority set forth in OMB Circular A-122.
Accordingly, such rates shall be applied to the extent
provided in such Circular to grants and contracts to which
OMB Circular A-122 applies, subject to any limitations in
part A of this section.  Copies of this document may be
provided by either party to other federal agencies
which have or intend to issue or award sponsored agreements
using these rates or to otherwise provide such agencies
with documentary notice of this agreement and its terms
and conditions.

D.   FIXED RATES WITH CARRYFORWARD PROVISIONS:   

     1.   This type of rate is considered final and not
subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions
of OMB Circular A-122 and the Federal Acquisition
Regulation, subject to the limitations contained in
Part A of this Section; except that the difference
between the estimated costs and the actual costs of the
period covered by the rate is carried forward as an
adjustment to the rate computation of a subsequent
period as discussed below.

     2.   The FY 99T rates contained in this agreement
are based on estimates of the costs for FY 99T.  When
actual costs for FY99T are determined, adjustments
will be applied to the next subsequent rate
negotiation to compensate for the differences between
the estimated FY 99T costs used to establish the
FY 99T fixed rates with carryforward provisions and
the negotiated actual FY 99T costs.

E.   PREDETERMINED RATES

The predetermined rates contained in this agreement
are not subject to adjustment in accordance with the
provisions of OMB Circular A-122, subject to the
limitations contained in Part A of this section. 

F.   Liquidation Of Prior Year Carryforward Amounts:

The FY 96 and FY97 carryforward amounts which have been
liquidated as part of the FY 99T fixed rates are based on
estimated amounts which will be adjusted at the time the
FY96 and FY97 final carryforward amounts are negotiated.
Differences between the FY 96 and FY97 estimated
carryforward amounts liquidated herein and the FY96 and
FY97 final negotiated carryforward amounts will be
liquidated through the fixed rates of a future year.

The purpose of this agreement is to establish fixed
rates with carryforward provisions for the period
1 July 1998 through 31 December 1998.  These rates are
based on the National Academy Of Sciences' proposal
dated 9 April 1998, and the establishment of these
rates by the Government based on the accounting systems
and allocation methodologies contained in this
proposal does not represent an agreement that these
systems and methodologies are accepted for fiscal year
99T or for any subsequent year's rate negotiation.
The recommendations of the Defense Contract Audit
Agency, District Branch in Audit Report 
#6261-98C23000001 were considered in the negotiation
of these rates.
