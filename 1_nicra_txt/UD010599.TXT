                         APPLICABLE TO

     (1)  Applies to DOD contracts awarded before November 30, 1993,
          all Non-DOD Instruments, and all DOD Grants.

     (2)  Applies to only DOD contracts awarded on or after
          November 30, 1993 in accordance with and under the authority
          of DFARS 231.303(1).  See Section II, Part E hereof.

SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

A. LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I of this
agreement is expressly subject to any statutory or administrative
limitations and is applicable to a given grant, contract,or other
agreement only to the extent that funds are available and consistent
with any and all limitations of cost clauses or provisions, if any,
contained therein.  Acceptance of any or all of the rates agreed to
herein is predicated upon all the following conditions: (1) that no
costs other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were
included in its indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that all
such costs are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and
allowable under the governing and applicable cost principles; (2)
that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not
claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs have been
accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) that the inf
ormation provided by the contractor/grantee, which was used as the
basis for the acceptance of the rate(s) agreed to herein and
expressly relied upon by the Government in accepting the said rates,
is not subsequently found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B. ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The provisional rates contained in Section I
of this agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at
the time this agreement was established. Changes to the method(s)
of accounting for costs which affects the amount of reimbursement
resulting from the use of these rates requires the express and
written approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant
negotiating agency for the Government prior to implementation of
any such changes.  Such changes include but are not limited to
changes in the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect
to direct.  Failure on the part of the grantee/contractor to obtain
the required approval may result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C. APPLICATION OF OFF-CAMPUS RATES:  New Mexico Institute of Mining
& Technology uses off-campus rates on projects for which ninety
percent (90%) or more of the expense will be incurred at a location
which is beyond the area maintained by components of the operations
maintenance organizational units and costs.

D. USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES: The rates set forth in SECTION I
hereof were established in accordance with and under the authority
set forth in OMB Circular A-21. Accordingly, such rates shall be
applied, to the extent provided in such circular, to grants and
contracts to which OMB Circular A-21 is applicable, subject to any
limitations in part A of this section.  Copies of this document may
be provided by either party to other Federal agencies which have or
intend to issue or award grants and/or contracts to New Mexico
Institute of Mining & Technology to use the stated rates or to
otherwise provide such agencies with documentary notice of this
agreement and its terms and conditions. 

E. APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DOD CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS:

     1.  Signature of this agreement by the authorized
representatives of New Mexico Institute of Mining & Technology and
the Government, acknowledges and affirms the institution's request
for waiver of the prohibition contained in DFARS 231.303(1) and the
Government's exercise of its discretion under DFARS 231.303(2) to
waive the prohibition in DFARS 231.303(1) for only the Facilities and
Administrative cost rates applicable to the Main Campus.  The waiver
request by New Mexico Institute of Mining & Technology is made to
simplify the institute's overall management of DOD cost reimbursements
under DOD contracts.

     2.  In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless
waived by the institution, see paragraph E.1. above) may be placed on
the reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred by an
institution of higher education under a DOD contract awarded on or after
November 30, 1993, unless the same limitation is applied uniformly to
all other organizations performing similar work.  It has been determined
by the Department of Defense that such limitation is not being
uniformly applied.  Accordingly, the rates cited (2) of Section I, as
explained under the title "APPLICABLE TO", do not reflect the
application of the 26% limitation on administrative indirect costs
imposed by OMB Circular A-21 where as (1) does.

F.   PROVISIONAL RATES: The provisional rates contained in this
agreement are subject to unilateral amendment by the Government or
bilateral amendment by the contracting parties at
any time.
