SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                                                                                                                                                          
A. LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is subject to any statutory
or administrative limitations and is applicable to a given grant, contract or other
agreement only to the extent that funds are available and consistent with any and all
limitations of cost clauses or provisions, if any, contained therein.  Acceptance of any
or all of the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon all the following condition
(1) that no costs other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in
its indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that all such costs are legal obligations
of the grantee/contractor and allowable under governing cost principles; (2) that the
same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3)
that similar types of costs, in like circumstances, have been accorded consistent
accounting treatment; and (4) that the information provided by the contractor/grantee,
which was used as the basis for the acceptance of the rates agreed to herein and
expressly relied upon by the Government in negotiating the said rates, is not
subsequently found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B. ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The rates contained in Section I of this agreement are based on
the accounting system in effect at the time this agreement was negotiated. Changes to
the method(s) of accounting for costs, which affects the amount of reimbursement
resulting from the use of these rates, require the written approval of the authorized
representative of  the cognizant negotiating agency for the Government prior to
implementation of any such changes.  Such changes include but are not limited to
changes in the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure
to obtain such approval may result in subsequent cost disallowance.

C. FIXED RATES WITH CARRY-FORWARD PROVISIONS:  The fixed rates contained in this
agreement are based on estimates of the costs for FY 2000. When actual costs for this
fiscal year are determined, adjustments will be applied to the next subsequent rate
negotiation to recognize the difference between the FY 2000 estimated costs used to
establish the fixed rates and the negotiated actual FY 2000 costs. 

D. PREDETERMINED RATES:  The predetermined rate contained in this agreement is not
subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21, subject
to the limitations contained in Part A of this section. 

E. CARRY-FORWARD AMOUNTS:  The fixed rates contained in this agreement are inclusive
of the actual unliquidated carry-forward amounts from FY 97 and estimated carry-forward
amounts from FY 1998.   The ARL Internal Overhead rate also includes a partial amount
of the estimated carry-forward for FY 1999. The Actual carry-forwards from FY 97 are
liquidated in its entirety as part of the FY 2000 Forward Pricing rates.  Actual
carry-forwards from FY 97 and estimated carry-forwards from FY 98 and FY 99  are as
follows:

                            FY 97 Actual         FY 98 Estimated       FY 99 Estimated
                            Carry -Forward       Carry -Forward        Carry -Forward
