SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

A.	LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is subject to any
statutory or administrative limitations, and is applicable to a given grant, contract
or other agreement only to the extent that funds are available and consistent with any
and all limitations of cost clauses or provisions, if any, contained therein.
Acceptance of the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon all the following
conditions: (1) that no costs other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were
included in the indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that all such costs are
legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under governing cost
principles; (2) that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not
claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs have been accorded consistent
accounting treatment; and (4) that the information provided by the contractor/grantee,
which was used as the basis for the acceptance of the rates agreed to herein and
expressly relied upon by the Government in negotiating and accepting the said rates,
is not subsequently found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.	ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The rates contained in Section I of this agreement are based
on the accounting system in effect at the time this agreement was negotiated, except as
noted in paragraph D below. Changes to the method(s) of accounting for costs which
affects the amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates require the
written approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant negotiating agency.
Such changes include but are not limited to changes in the charging of a particular type
of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure to obtain such approval may result in
subsequent cost disallowances.

C.	USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES: The rates set forth in Section I hereof were
negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB Circular A-21.
Accordingly, such rates shall be applied to the extent provided in such circular to
grants and contracts to which OMB Circular A-21 applies, subject to any limitations
in paragraph A above.  Copies of this document may be provided by either party to
other Federal agencies which have or intend to issue or award grants and contracts
using these rates as a means of providing them with early notification of the
agreement contained herein.

D.	QUALIFICATIONS:  The parties have agreed to these rates with the following
understanding:

	1) The Government's agreement with these rates is not an acceptance of
Stanford's accounting systems, allocation methodologies, cost analysis studies, and
carryforwards from past years relative to the FY 1999 proposals.

	2) The Government's use, during these negotiations, of any data submitted
by Stanford from a cost analysis study in support of its proposals, either completed
or partially completed, shall not be considered as acceptance or pre-approval of
such study.

	3) This agreement does not alter the Government?s or Stanford's previously
stated positions on historical cost issues, Memorandum of Understanding (MOUs), type
of rates, or existing litigation.

	4) Furthermore, the parties agree this rate agreement for Stanford's FY 1999
facilities and administrative cost and fringe benefits rates will not be cited by
either party for purposes other than as a rate agreement between the parties on
Stanford facilities and administrative cost and fringe benefits rates for FY 1999.

	5) Stanford is not making any concessions or admissions about the
allowability of any costs.  By agreeing to accept less than its proposed costs in
these rates, Stanford is not stating or implying that any costs were ever
unallowable or inappropriate, nor is it agreeing to a similar treatment of these
costs in the future.

	6) The rates contained in Section I of this agreement are based on the
inclusion of research training grants in the Organized Research MTDC base.  

	(7) The Government has agreed to Stanford University's 8 June 1999 request
for a one year deferral of the provision in OMB Circular A-21, Section J.12.b.(2),
which states that the depreciation methods used to calculate the depreciation
amounts for F&A rate purposes shall be the same methods used by the institution for
its financial statements. Accordingly, Stanford University agrees to comply fully
with this provision in fiscal year 2000.

E.	FIXED FRINGE BENEFITS RATES AND CARRY-FORWARD PROVISION: The Fringe Benefits
rates contained in this agreement are based on estimates of the costs for FY 1999.
When the actual costs for FY 1999 are determined, adjustments may be made to the
rates of a future year to recognize the difference between the FY 1999 estimated
costs used to establish the fixed rates and the negotiated actual FY 1999 costs.

F.	PREDETERMINED FACILITIES & ADMINISTRATIVE COST RATES: The predetermined
facilities and administrative cost rates for FY 1999 contained in this agreement
are subject only to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of OMB
Circular A-21.

G.	CARRY-FORWARD AMOUNTS: The Facilities and Administrative cost rates
applicable to Organized Research and VSC are inclusive of final FY 1996 carry
forward amounts as recorded in the FY 1996 Final Rate and Carry-forward
Negotiation Agreement dated August 10, 1998.  The On Campus Organized Research
rate is inclusive of a $4,630,836 University over-recovery. The Off Campus
Organized Research rate is inclusive of a $57,075 University over-recovery.
The VSC rate is inclusive of a $175,102 University under-recovery.

H.	DFARS WAIVER: Signature of this agreement by the authorized
representative of Stanford University and the Government acknowledges and
affirms the University?s request to waive the prohibition contained in
DFARS 231.303(1) and the Government's exercise of its discretion contained
in DFARS 231.303(2) to waive the prohibition in DFARS 231.303(1). The waiver
request by Stanford University is made to simplify the University?s overall
management of DOD cost reimbursements under DOD contracts.

The undersigned hereby declare that the terms of this document have been
completely read and are fully understood and voluntarily accepted.

The individuals executing this agreement are authorized to execute for and
on behalf of the parties for whom they sign and do so as their free and
voluntary act.
