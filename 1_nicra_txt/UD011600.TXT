A. LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is subject
to any statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable to a
given grant, contract or other agreement only to the extent that funds
are available and consistent with any and all limitations of cost
clauses or provisions, if any, contained therein.  Acceptance of any
or all of the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon all the
following conditions: (1) that no costs other than those incurred by
the grantee/contractor were included in its indirect cost pool as
finally accepted and that all such costs are legal obligations of
the grantee/contractor and allowable under governing cost principles;
(2) that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are
not claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs, in
like circumstances, have been accorded consistent accounting treatment;
and (4) that the information provided by the contractor/grantee, which
was used as the basis for the acceptance of the rates agreed to herein
and expressly relied upon by the Government in negotiating the said
rates, is not subsequently found to be materially incomplete or
inaccurate.

B. ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The rates contained in Section I of this
agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at the time
this agreement was negotiated. Changes to the method(s) of 
accounting for costs, which affects the amount of reimbursement
resulting from the use of these rates, require the written approval
of the authorized representative of  the cognizant negotiating
agency for the Government prior to implementation of any such
changes.  Such changes include but are not limited to changes in the
charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct.
Failure to obtain such approval may result in subsequent cost
disallowance.

C. PREDETERMINED RATES:  The predetermined rates contained
in this agreement are not subject to adjustment in accordance
with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21, subject to the
limitations contained in Part A of this section.

E. USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in Section I
hereof were negotiated in accordance with and under the authority
set forth in OMB Circular A-21.  Accordingly, such rates shall be
applied to the extent provided in such circular to grants, contracts
and other agreements to which OMB Circular A-21 is applicable,
subject to any limitations in part A of this section. Copies of this
document may be provided by either party to other Federal agencies
which have or intend to issue or award grants and contracts using
these rates or to otherwise provide such agencies with documentary
notice of this agreement and its terms and conditions.

F. SPECIAL REMARKS: The purpose of this agreement is to establish
predetermined rates for the period 1 July 1999 through 30 June 2000.
These rates are based on GIT/GTRC's proposal dated 9 April 1999 and
the establishment of these rates by the Government based on the
accounting systems and allocation methodologies contained in this
proposal does not represent an agreement that these systems and
methodologies are accepted for Fiscal Year 2000, or for any
subsequent year's rate negotiation.  The recommendations of the
Defense Contract Audit Agency Audit Reports No. 1101-99T2300004
was considered in the negotiation of these rates.
