A.   LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is subject to any
statutory or administrative limitations, and is applicable to a given grant,
contract or other agreement only to the extent that funds are available and
consistent with any and all limitations of cost clauses or provisions, if any,
contained therein.  Acceptance of the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon
all the following conditions: (1) that no costs other than those incurred by
the grantee/contractor were included in the indirect cost pool as finally
accepted and that all such costs are legal obligations of the grantee/
contractor and allowable under governing  cost principles; (2) that the same
costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct
costs; (3) that similar types of costs have been accorded consistent
accounting treatment; and (4) that the information provided by the
contractor/grantee, which was used as the basis for the acceptance of the
rates agreed to herein and expressly relied upon by the Government in
negotiating and accepting the said rates is not subsequently found to
be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.   ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The rates contained in Section I of this
agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at the time
this agreement was negotiated. Changes to the method(s) of accounting
for costs which affects the amount of reimbursement resulting from
the use of these rates require the written approval of the authorized
representative of the cognizant negotiating agency for the Government
prior to implementation of any such changes.  Such changes include
but are not limited to changes in the charging of a particular type
of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure to obtain such approval
may result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C.   USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in
Section I hereof were negotiated in accordance with and under the
authority set forth in OMB Circular A-21.  Accordingly, such rates
shall be applied to the extent provided in such circular to grants,
contracts and other agreements to which OMB Circular A-21 is
applicable, subject to any limitations in part A of this section.
Copies of this document may be provided by either party to other
Federal agencies which have or intend to issue or award grants
and contracts using these rates or to otherwise provide such
agencies with documentary notice of this agreement and its terms
and conditions.

D.   PROVISIONAL RATES: The provisional rate contained in this
agreement is subject to unilateral amendment by the Government
or bilateral amendment by the contracting parties at any time.
