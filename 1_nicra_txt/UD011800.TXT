SECTION II - GENERAL                                                    

A.   LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is subject to any
statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable to a given grant or
contract only to the extent that funds are available.  Acceptance of the rates
agreed to herein is predicated upon all of the following conditions: (1) that
no costs other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in
the above indirect cost pools as finally accepted and that such costs are legal
obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under governing cost
principles, (2) that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs
are not claimed as direct costs, (3) that similar types of costs have been
accorded consistent accounting treatment, and (4) that the information provided
by the grantee/contractor which was used as a basis for acceptance of the rates
agreed to herein, and expressly relied upon by the Government in negotiating and
accepting the said rates is not subsequently found to be materially incomplete
or inaccurate.     

B.   ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The rates contained in Section I of this agreement
are based on the accounting system in effect at the time the agreement was
negotiated.  Changes to the method(s) of accounting for costs which affect the
amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates require the prior
approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant negotiation agency.
Such changes include but are not limited to changes in the charging of a
particular type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure to obtain such
approval may result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C.   USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in Section I were
negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB Circular
A-122 and the FAR. Accordingly, such rates shall be applied to the extent
provided in OMB Circular A-122 and the FAR to grants and contracts to which
OMB Circular A-122 and the FAR apply, subject to any limitations in part A
of this section.  Copies of this document may be provided by either party to
other federal agencies which have or intend to issue or award sponsored
agreements using these rates or to otherwise provide such agencies with
documentary notice of this agreement and its terms and conditions.

D.   SPECIAL REMARKS: The purpose of this agreement is to establish
provisional indirect cost, fringe benefits and cost of money rates for the
period 1 July 1999 through 30 June 2000.  The establishment of these rates
by the Government based on the accounting systems and allocation
methodologies in effect at the time this rate agreement is signed does
not represent an agreement that these systems and methodologies are accepted
for Fiscal Year 2000, or for any subsequent year's rate negotiation.
