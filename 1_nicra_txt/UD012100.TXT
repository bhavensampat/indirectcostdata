SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                                                                  
A.  LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I of this agreement
is
expressly subject to any statutory or administrative limitations and is
applicable
to a given grant, contract, or other agreement only to the extent that funds are
available and consistent with any and all limitations of cost clauses or
provisions,
if any, contained therein.  Acceptance of any or all of the rates agreed to
herein
is predicated upon all the following conditions: (1) that no costs other than
those
incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in its indirect cost pool as
finally
accepted and that all such costs are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor
and
allowable under the governing and applicable cost principles; (2) that the same
costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs;
(3)
that similar types of costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment;
and
(4) that the information provided by the contractor/grantee, which was used as
the
basis for the acceptance of the rate(s) agreed to herein and expressly relied
upon by the Government accepting the said rates, is not subsequently found to be
materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The rates contained in Section I of this agreement are
based on the accounting system in effect at the time this agreement was
established.
Changes to the method(s) of accounting for costs which affects the amount of
reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates requires the express and
written approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant negotiating
agency for the Government prior to implementation of any such changes. 
Such changes include but are not limited to changes in the charging of
a particular type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure on the part of the
grantee/contractor to obtain the required approval may result in subsequent cost
disallowances.

C. PREDETERMINED RATES: The predetermined indirect cost rate contained in this
agreement is not subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of OMB
Circular A-21, subject to the limitations contained in Part A of this section.

D. FIXED RATES: The fixed rates in this agreement are based on estimates of the
costs for FY2000.  When actual costs for the periods are determined, an
adjustment will be made to the rates of a future year to recognize the
difference between the FY 2000 estimated costs used to establish the fixed
rates and the negotiated actual FY 2000 costs.
