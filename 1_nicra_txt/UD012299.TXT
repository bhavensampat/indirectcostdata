SECTION II - GENERAL                                                    

A.   LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is subject
to any statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable to a
given grant or contract only to the extent that funds are available.
Acceptance of the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon  the
following conditions: (1) that no costs other than those incurred by the
grantee/contractor were included in this indirect cost pool as finally
accepted and that such costs are legal obligations of the grantee/
contractor and allowable under governing cost principles; (2) that the
same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed
as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs have been accorded
consistent accounting treatment; and (4) that the information provided
by the grantee/contractor which was used as a basis for acceptance of
the rates agreed to herein, and expressly relied upon by the
Government in negotiating and accepting the said rates is not
subsequently found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.          

B.   ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The rates contained in Section I of this
agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at the time
the agreement was negotiated.  Changes to the method(s) of accounting
for costs which affect the amount of reimbursement resulting from the
use of these rates require the prior approval of the authorized
representative of the cognizant negotiation agency.  Such changes
include but are not limited to changes in the charging of a
particular type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure to
obtain such approval may result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C.   USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in Section
I were negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set
forth in OMB Circular A-122. Accordingly, such rates shall be
applied to the extent provided in such Circular to grants and
contracts to which OMB Circular A-122  applies, subject to any
limitations in part A of this section.  Copies of this
document may be provided by either party to other federal
agencies which have or intend to issue or award sponsored
agreements using these rates or to otherwise provide such agencies
with documentary notice of this agreement and its terms and conditions.

D.   FIXED RATES WITH CARRYFORWARD PROVISIONS: The fixed rates
contained in this agreement are based on estimates of the costs for
FY 1999 and FY 2000.  When actual costs for FY 1999 are determined,
over or under recoveries may be included as an adjustment to a
subsequent rate negotiation to recover the difference between the
FY 1999 estimated costs used to establish the fixed rates and the
negotiated FY 1999 actua  costs.    When actual costs for FY 2000
are determined, over or under recoveries may be included as an
adjustment to a subsequent rate negotiation to recover the
difference between the FY 2000 estimated costs used to establish
the fixed rates and the negotiated FY 2000 actual costs.

E.   PREDETERMINED RATES: The predetermined rates contained in
this agreement are not subject to adjustment in accordance with
the provisions of OMB Circular A-122, subject to the limitations
contained in Part A of this section. 

F.   CARRY-FORWARD AMOUNTS: The rates set forth in Section I
include liquidation of the following prior year carryforward
amounts as follows:

G.  SPECIAL REMARKS: The establishment of these rates by the
Government, based on the accounting systems and allocation
methodologies contained in effect at the time the agreement
was negotiated does not represent an agreement that these
systems and methodologies are accepted for fiscal years 1999
and 2000 or for any subsequent rate negotiation.
