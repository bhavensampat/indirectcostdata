INSTITUTION: MASSACHUSETTS MENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH CORPORATION         
             BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS  02115  

The Indirect Cost rate contained herein is for use on grants and contracts with
all Federal Agencies in accordance with the provisions and costs principles
mandated by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-122.  This post
determined final rate shall be used for billing purposes for the Massachusetts
Mental Health Research Corporation?s (MMHRC) Fiscal Year 1998.  This rate
agreement supersedes all previous rate agreements/determinations
for Fiscal Year 1998.

SECTION II:  GENERAL 

A.  LIMIYATIONS:  Use of these rates set forth under Section I of this agreement is
expressly subject to any statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable
to a given grant, contract, or other agreement only to the extent that funds are
available and consistent with any and all limitations of cost clauses or
provisions, if any, contained therein.  Acceptance of any or all of the
rates agreed to herein is predicated upon all the following conditions: (1)
that no costs other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were included
in its indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that all such costs are legal
obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under the governing and
applicable cost principles; (2) that the same costs that have been treated as
indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs
have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) that the information
provided by the contractor/grantee, which was used as the basis for the
acceptance of the rates agreed to herein and expressly relied upon by the
Government in accepting the said rates, is not subsequently found to be
materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B. ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The post determined rate contained in Section I of this
agreement is based on the accounting system in effect for MMHRC?s Fiscal Year
1998.  Changes to the method(s) of accounting for costs which affects the
amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of this rate requires the
express and written approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant
negotiating agency for the Government prior to implementation of any such
changes.  Such changes include but are not limited to changes in the charging
of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct.   Failure on the part
of the grantee/contractor to obtain the required approval may result in
subsequent cost disallowance.

C. USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES: The rate set forth in Section I hereof was
negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB
Circular A-122.  Accordingly, such rate shall be applied, to the extent
provided in such circular, to grants, contracts and/or cooperative
agreements to which OMB Circular A-122 is applicable, subject to any
limitations in part A of this section. Copies of this document may be
provided by either party to other Federal agencies which have or
intend to issue or award grants, contracts, and/or other sponsored
agreements to the Massachusetts Mental Health Research Corporation
to use the stated rate or to otherwise provide such agencies with
documentary notice of this agreement and its terms and conditions.
The post-determined rate set forth in this agreement is based on
MMHRC?s Fiscal Year 1998 Indirect Cost rate proposal, dated
16 March 1999, and the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) Audit
Report No. 2171-99H10250062, dated 1 September 1999.
