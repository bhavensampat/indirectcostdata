SECTION II: GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

A.  LIMITATION: Use of the rates set forth in Section I is  subject to any
statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable to a given grant,
contract, or other agreement only to the extent that funds are available and
consistent with any and all limitations of cost clauses or provisions, if any,
contained therein.   Acceptance of any or all of the rates agreed to herein is
predicated upon all the following conditions: (1) that no costs other than
those incurred by the contractor/grantee were included in its indirect cost
pool as finally accepted and that all such costs are legal obligations of
the contractor/grantee and allowable under governing cost principles; (2)
that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed
as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs have been accorded
consistent accounting treatment; and (4) the information provided by the
contractor/grantee,  which was used as the basis for acceptance
of the rates agreed to herein and expressly relied upon by the
Government in negotiating the said rates, is not subsequently found to
be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B  ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The rates contained in Section I of this agreement
are based on the accounting system in effect at the time this agreement
was negotiated.  Changes to the method(s) of accounting for costs, which
affect the amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates,
 require the written approval of the authorized representative of the
cognizant negotiating agency for the Government prior to implementation
of any such changes.  Such changes include, but are not limited to,
changes in the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to
direct.  Failure to obtain such approval may result in a  subsequent
cost disallowance.

C.  FIXED RATES AND CARRYFORWARD PROVISIONS:

1.   This type of rate is considered final and not subject to
adjustment in accordance with the provisions of OMB circular
A-21 and the Federal Acquisition Regulation, subject to the
limitations contained in Part A of this section, except that the
difference between the estimated costs and the actual costs of the
period covered by the rate is carried forward as an adjustment to
the rate computation of a subsequent period as discussed below.

2.  The rates contained  in this agreement are based on estimates
of the costs for FY 2000.  When actual costs for this period are
determined, adjustments will be applied to the FY 2001 negotiated
fixed rates to recognize the difference between the estimated
FY 2000 costs used to establish the fixed rates and the negotiated
actual FY 2000 costs.

3.   The Fringe Benefit rates set forth herein include the
following estimated FY 1999 carryforward amounts:

(O) Denotes Over-recovery

(*)   The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has established a self-insurance
trust fund for the purpose of paying workers' compensation claims for employees paid
from sponsored accounts.  It is understood and agreed that the university shall have
no right of recapture of the reserves in the self-insurance trust fund.  In the event
that the university terminates the self-insurance trust fund and purchases workers'
compensation insurance, any unencumbered reserves in the self-insurance trust fund
shall be used to pay the workers' compensation insurance premiums until such reserves
have been exhausted.

As of 7/1/99 the self-insurance trust fund had a reserve balance of $773,939.  The
reserve balance is defined as the account balance less discounted liabilities
associated with claims currently being paid.  The $773,939  reserve balance is
expected to be reduced by approximately $32,793 in  FY 2000, calculated as follows:
the sum of the actuarial funding recommendation at the mean confidence level, plus
administrative expense, less projected interest income, less income generated by
the nominal .01% rate assessment against the salary and wage base.  The university
believes that a minimum reserve balance of $500,000 is necessary in order to pay
routine workers' compensation claims plus such extraordinary claims as a death,
or two- three serious injuries in any given year. It is agreed that the university
will not increase the .01% rate unless the year-end reserve balance in the
self-insurance trust fund falls below $500,000.

D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in Section I hereof  were
negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB Circular A-21. 
Accordingly, such rates shall be applied to the extent provided in such Circular
to grants, contracts and other agreements to which OMB Circular A-21 is applicable,
subject to any limitations in part A of this section.  Copies of this document may
be provided by either party to other Federal agencies which have or intend to issue
or award grants and contracts using these rates or to otherwise provide such
agencies with documentary notice of this agreement and its terms and conditions.
