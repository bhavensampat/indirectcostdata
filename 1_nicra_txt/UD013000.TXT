applicable to a given grant, contract, or other agreement only to the extent
that funds are available and consistent with any and all limitations of cost
clauses or provisions, if any, contained therein.  Acceptance of any or all

principles; (2) that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs
are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs have been
accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) that the information
provided by the contractor/grantee, which was used as the basis for the
acceptance of the rate(s) agreed to herein and expressly relied upon by the
Government in negotiating and accepting the said rates, is not subsequently
found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

costs which affects the amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of
these rates requires the express and written approval of the authorized
representative of the cognizant negotiating agency for the Government
prior to implementation of any such changes.  Such changes include but
are not limited to changes in the charging of a particular type of cost
from indirect to direct.  Failure on the part of the grantee/contractor
to obtain the required approval may result in subsequent cost
disallowances.

agreement are not subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions
