SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

A.	LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is subject
to any statutory or administrative limitations, and is applicable to a
given grant, contract or other agreement only to the extent that funds are
available and consistent with any and all limitations of cost clauses or
provisions, if any, contained therein.  Acceptance of the rates agreed to
herein is predicated upon all the following conditions: (1) that no costs
other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in the
indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that all such costs are legal
obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under governing cost
principles; (2) that the same costs that have been treated as indirect
costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs
have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) that the
information provided by the contractor/grantee, which was used as the
basis for the acceptance of the rates agreed to herein and expressly
relied upon by the Government in negotiating and accepting the said
rates, is not subsequently found to be materially incomplete or
inaccurate.

B.	ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The rates contained in Section I of
this agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at the time
this agreement was negotiated, except as noted in paragraph D below.
Changes to the method(s) of accounting for costs which affects the amount
of reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates require the
written approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant
negotiating agency.  Such changes include but are not limited to changes
in the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct.
Failure to obtain such approval may result in subsequent cost
disallowances.

C.	USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES: The rates set forth in Section I
hereof were negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set
forth in OMB Circular A-21.  Accordingly, such rates shall be applied to
the extent provided in such circular to grants and contracts to which OMB
Circular A-21 applies, subject to any limitations in paragraph A above.
Copies of this document may be provided by either party to other Federal
agencies which have or intend to issue or award grants and contracts
using these rates as a means of providing them with early notification of
the agreement contained herein.

D.	QUALIFICATIONS:  The parties have agreed to these rates with the
following understanding:

	1) The Government's agreement with these rates is not an
acceptance of Stanford's accounting systems, allocation methodologies,
cost analysis studies, and carryforwards from past years relative to the
FY 2000 proposals.

	2) The Government's use, during these negotiations, of any data
submitted by Stanford from a cost analysis study in support of its
proposals, either completed or partially completed, shall not be
considered as acceptance or pre-approval of such study.

	3) Furthermore, the parties agree this rate agreement for
Stanford's FY 2000 facilities and administrative cost and fringe
benefits rates will not be cited by either party for purposes other
than as a rate agreement between the parties on Stanford facilities
and administrative cost and fringe benefits rates for FY 2000.

	4) Stanford is not making any concessions or admissions
about the allowability of any costs.  By agreeing to accept less than
its proposed costs in these rates, Stanford is not stating or implying
that any costs were ever unallowable or inappropriate, nor is it
agreeing to a similar treatment of these costs in the future.

E.	FIXED FRINGE BENEFITS RATES AND CARRY-FORWARD PROVISION:
The Fringe Benefits rates contained in this agreement are based on
estimates of the costs for FY 2000.  When the actual costs for FY 2000
are determined, adjustments may be made to the rates of a future year
to recognize the difference between the FY 2000 estimated costs used to
establish the fixed rates and the negotiated actual FY 2000 costs.

F.	PREDETERMINED FACILITIES & ADMINISTRATIVE COST RATES: The
predetermined facilities and administrative cost rates for FY 2000
contained in this agreement are subject only to adjustment in
accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21.

G.	CARRY-FORWARD AMOUNTS:

	1.  The Facilities and Administrative cost rates applicable to
Organized Research are inclusive of final FY 1996 carry-forward amounts
as recorded in the FY 1996 Final Rate and Carry-forward Negotiation
Agreement dated August 10, 1998.  The On Campus Organized Research rate
is inclusive of a $4,630,836 University over-recovery. The Off Campus

representative of Stanford University and the Government acknowledges
and affirms the University's request to waive the prohibition contained
in DFARS 231.303(1) and the Government's exercise of its discretion
contained in DFARS 231.303(2) to waive the prohibition in
DFARS 231.303(1).  The waiver request by Stanford University is made to
simplify the University's overall management of DOD cost reimbursements
under DOD contracts.
