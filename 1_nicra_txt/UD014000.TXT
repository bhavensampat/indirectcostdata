SECTION II - GENERAL                                                    

A.   LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is subject to any/
statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable to a given grant or
contract only to the extent that funds are available.  Acceptance of the rates
agreed to herein is predicated upon  the following conditions: (1) that no costs
other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in this indirect
cost pool as finally accepted and that such costs are legal obligations of the
grantee/contractor and allowable under governing cost principles; (2) that the
same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct
costs, (3) that similar types of costs have been accorded consistent accounting
treatment; and (4) that the information provided by the grantee/contractor which
was used as a basis for acceptance of the rates agreed to herein, and expressly
relied upon by the Government in negotiating and accepting the said rates is not
subsequently found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.          

B.   ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The rates contained in Section I of this agreement are
based on the accounting system in effect at the time the agreement was negotiated. 
Changes to the method(s) of accounting for costs which affect the amount of
reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates require the prior approval
of the authorized representative of the cognizant negotiation agency.  Such changes
include but are not limited to changes in the charging of a particular type of cost
from indirect to direct.  Failure to obtain such approval may result in subsequent
cost disallowances.

C.   USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in Section I were
negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB Circular
A-122.  Accordingly, such rates shall be applied to the extent provided in such
Circular to grants and contracts to which OMB Circular A-122 applies, subject to
any limitations in part A of this section.  Copies of this document may be
provided by either party to other federal agencies which have or intend to issue
or award sponsored agreements using these rates or to otherwise provide such
agencies with documentary notice of this agreement and its terms and conditions.

D.   FIXED RATES WITH CARRYFORWARD PROVISIONS:   

     1.   This type of rate is considered final and not subject to adjustment in
accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-122 and the Federal Acquisition
Regulation, subject to the limitations contained in Part A of this Section; except
that the difference between the estimated costs and the actual costs of the period
covered by the rate is carried forward as an adjustment to the rate computation of
a subsequent period as discussed below.

     2.   The FY 2000 rates contained in this agreement are based on estimates of
the costs for FY 2000.  When actual costs for FY 2000 are determined, adjustments
will be applied to the next subsequent rate negotiation to compensate for the
differences between the estimated FY 2000 costs used to establish the FY 2000
fixed rates with carryforward provisions and the negotiated actual FY 2000 costs.

SECTION III: SPECIAL REMARKS

A.     FRINGE RATE:   From FY1986 through FY1994 the Institution set aside accrual
funding to cover the estimated current and future costs of its Supplemental
Employee Retirement Plan (SERP).  The rates set forth herein are predicated on the
Government's agreement to accept its prorata share of the accrued expense
accumulated from the inception of the Institution's SERP through 31 December 1994,
provided that:

     1.  As of 1 January 1995 the accrued balance (including accumulated interest)
in the SERP fund shall be placed in a separate account where its use will be
restricted to the payment of supplemental employee retirement costs;

     2.  Future interest earned on the SERP fund balance will remain in the SERP
fund.

     3.  The Institution will use the SERP fund (including accumulated and future
interest) to pay SERP costs, and will add to the fund only if it becomes exhausted
due to payment of supplemental employee retirement benefits as defined in the SERP.

     4.  If the SERP fund becomes exhausted before all supplemental employee
retirement costs have been paid, the Institution will make further payments to the
SERP fund on a Pay-As-You-Go basis; and 

     5.  The Government shall receive a prorata refund of any balance remaining in
the SERP fund at the conclusion or termination of the SERP.

B.     LIQUIDATION OF PRIOR YEAR CARRYFORWARD AMOUNTS:   The fixed rates set
forth herein include the liquidation of the following carryforward amounts:

(O) Denotes Over-recovery                 (U) Denotes Under-recovery

The purpose of this agreement is to establish fixed rates with
carryforward provisions for the period 1 January  through
31 December 2000.  These rates are based on Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution's proposal dated 29 November 1999, and the establishment of
these rates by the Government based on the accounting systems and
allocation methodologies contained in this proposal does not represent an
agreement that these systems and methodologies are accepted for Fiscal
Year 2000 or for any subsequent year's rate negotiation.  The
recommendations of the Defense Contract Audit Agency, Northern New
England Branch in Audit Report #2161-2000P23000001 were considered in the
negotiation of these rates.
