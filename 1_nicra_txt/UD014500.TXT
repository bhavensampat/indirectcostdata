                         APPLICABLE TO

Instruments, and all DOD Grants.

(2)  Applies to only DOD contracts awarded on or after November 30, 1993 in accordance
with and under the authority of DFARS 231.303(1).  See Section II, Part G.2. hereof.

SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

A.   LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is subject to any
statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable to a given grant,
contract or other agreement only to the extent that funds are available and consistent
with any and all limitations of cost clauses or provisions, if any, contained therein.
Acceptance of the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon all of the following
conditions: (1) that no costs other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor
were included in this indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that such costs
are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under governing cost
principles; (2) that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not
claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs have been accorded consistent
accounting treatment; and (4) that the information provided by the grantee/contractor,
which was used as the basis for acceptance of the rates agreed to herein and expressly
relied upon by the Government in negotiating and accepting the said rates, is not
subsequently found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.   ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The rates contained in Section I of this agreement are based
on the accounting system in effect at the time the agreement was negotiated.  Changes
to the method(s) of accounting for costs which affect the amount of reimbursement
resulting from the use of these rates require the written approval of the authorized
representative of the cognizant negotiating agency for the Government prior to
implementation of any such changes.  Such changes include but are not limited to
changes in the charging of a particular type of costs from indirect to direct.  Failure
to obtain such approval may result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C.   FIXED RATES: The fixed rates contained in this agreement are based on estimates of
the costs for FY 2000.  When actual costs for FY 2000 are determined, adjustments will
be applied to a subsequent rate negotiation to recognize the difference between the
FY 2000 estimated costs used to establish the fixed rates and the negotiated actual
FY 2000 costs.  

D.   CARRY-FORWARD AMOUNTS: The rates set forth in Section I are inclusive of  FY 1997
and FY 1998 carry-forward amounts, as established by Negotiation Agreements for FY 1997
and 1998 Final Rates and Carry-forwards dated 28 February 2000.

E.   USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in Section I hereof were
negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB Circular A-21. 
Accordingly, such rates shall be applied to the extent provided in such circular to
grants and contracts to which OMB Circular A-21 is applicable, subject to any
limitations in part A of this section.  Copies of this document may be provided by
either party to other Federal agencies which have or intend to issue or award grants
and contracts using these rates or otherwise provide such agencies with documentary
notice of this agreement and its terms and conditions.

F.   SPECIAL REMARKS:  NM Tech uses off-campus rates on projects for which ninety
(90%) or more of the expense will be incurred at a location which is beyond the
area maintained by components of the operations maintenance organizational units
and costs.

G.    APPLICATION OF FACILITY & ADMINISTRATIVE COST RATES TO DoD         
      CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS:  

     1.  Signature of this agreement by the authorized representatives of New Mexico
Institute of Mining & Technology and the Government, acknowledges and affirms the
institution's request for waiver of the prohibition contained in DFARS 231.303(1)
and the Government's exercise of its discretion under DFARS 231.303(2) to waive the
prohibition in DFARS 231.303(1) for all Main Campus Facilities and Administrative
cost rates and the EMRTC F&A rates applicable to Other Sponsored Agreements.  The
waiver request by New Mexico Institute of Mining & Technology is made to simplify
the institute's overall management of DOD cost reimbursements under DOD contracts.

     2.  In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless waived by the
institution, see paragraph G.1. above) may be placed on the reimbursement of
otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred by an institution of higher education
under a DOD contract awarded on or after November 30, 1993, unless the same
limitation is applied uniformly to all other organizations performing similarwork.
It has been determined by the Department of Defense that such limitation is not
being uniformly applied.  Accordingly, the rates cited (2) of Section I, as
explained under the title "APPLICABLE TO", do not reflect the application of the
26% limitation on administrative indirect costs imposed by OMB Circular A-21 where
as (1) does.
