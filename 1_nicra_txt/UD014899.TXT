such costs are legal obligations of the contractor/grantee and allowable under governing
cost principles; (2) that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are

B. ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The rates contained in this agreement are based on the
accounting system in effect at the time this agreement was negotiated.  Changes to the
method of accounting for costs which affect the amount of reimbursement resulting from
the use of this rate requires the approval of the authorized representative of the
cognizant agency.  Such changes include, but are not limited to, changes in the
charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure to obtain
approval may result in cost disallowances.
