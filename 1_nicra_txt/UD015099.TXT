SECTION II - GENERAL

A.   LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is subject to any
statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable to a given grant or
contract only to the extent that funds are available.  Acceptance of the rates
agreed to herein is predicated upon all of the following conditions: (1) that no
costs other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in the
above indirect cost pools as finally accepted and that such costs are legal
obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under governing cost
principles, (2) that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs
are not claimed as direct costs, (3) that similar types of costs have been
accorded consistent accounting treatment, and (4) that the information provided
by the grantee/contractor which was used as a basis for acceptance of the rates
agreed to herein, and expressly relied upon by the Government in negotiating and
accepting the said rates is not subsequently found to be materially incomplete
or inaccurate.     
    
B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The final rates contained in Section I of this agreement
are based on the accounting system in effect at the time the agreement was
negotiated.  Changes to the method(s) of accounting for costs which affect the
amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates require the prior
approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant negotiation agency.
Such changes include but are not limited to changes in the charging of a
particular type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure to obtain such approval
may result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The final rates set forth in Section I were
negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB Circular
A-122 and the FAR.  Accordingly, such rates shall be applied to the extent
provided in OMB Circular A-122 and the FAR to grants and contracts to which OMB
Circular A-122 and the FAR apply, subject to any limitations in part A of this
section.  Copies of this document may be provided by either party to other
federal agencies which have or intend to issue or award sponsored agreements
using these rates or to otherwise provide such agencies with documentary notice
of this agreement and its terms and conditions.

D.  LIQUIDATION OF PRIOR YEAR CARRYFORWARD AMOUNTS: Shown below are the prior
year carryforward amounts that are being liquidated through the FY 99 final
rates set forth above, in recognition of GTRI converting to the FAR 31.2 cost
principles in FY 99.

                             FRINGE BENEFITS

1.  The FY 99 "Full Fringe Benefit" rate set forth above includes the
liquidation of the final FY 1997  over-recovery amount of $255,747 and the
FY 1998  over-recovery amount of $310,292.

2.  The FY 99 "Partial Fringe Benefit" rate set forth above includes the
liquidation of the final FY 1997 under-recovery amount of $ 7,558 and the
FY 1998  over-recovery amount of $10,112.

$       000           Balance

(U)  Denotes Under-recovery
(O)  Denotes Over-recovery

The prior year carry-forwards shown in the above table resulted from fiscal years in
which GTRI's fixed overhead rates and carryforward amounts were determined in
accordance with the requirements of OMB Circular A-21. Effective with FY99, GTRI's
recovery of direct and indirect costs (indicated by the rates shown in Section I
above) were  governed by the cost principles set forth at FAR Section 31.2.
Therefore, all remaining prior year carryforward amounts that were  determined in
accordance with OMB Circular A-21 have been liquidated by means of adjustments
to GTRI's  FY99 Rates.

E.   SPECIAL REMARKS: The purpose of this agreement is to establish final indirect
cost, fringe benefits and cost of money rates for the period 1 July 1998 through
30 June 1999.  The establishment of these rates by the Government based on the
accounting systems and allocation methodologies in effect at the time this rate
agreement is signed does not represent an agreement that these systems and
methodologies are accepted for fiscal year 1999, or for any subsequent year's
rate negotiation.
