SECTION II: LIMITATIONS

A. LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I of this agreement is
expressly subject to any statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable
to a given grant, contract, or other agreement only to the extent that funds are
available and consistent with any and all limitations of cost clauses or provisions,
if any, contained therein.  Acceptance of any or all of the rates agreed to herein
is predicated upon all the following conditions: (1) that no costs other than those
incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in its indirect cost pool as
finally accepted and that all such costs are legal obligations of the grantee/
contractor and allowable under the governing and applicable cost principles; (2)
that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as
direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs have been accorded consistent
accounting treatment; and (4) that the information provided by the contractor/
grantee, which was used as the basis for the acceptance of the rate(s) agreed to
herein and expressly relied upon by the Government in accepting the said rates,
is not subsequently found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B. ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The fixed rates contained in Section I of this agreement
are based on the accounting system in effect at the time this agreement was
issued.  Changes to the method(s) of accounting for costs which affects the
amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates requires the
express and written approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant
negotiating agency for the Government prior to implementation of any such
changes.  Such changes include but are not limited to changes in the charging
of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure on the part of
the grantee/contractor to obtain the required approval may result in
subsequent cost disallowances.

C.  FIXED RATES WITH CARRY-FORWARD PROVISIONS: The fixed rates contained in
this agreement are based on estimates of the costs for FY 2000.  When actual
costs for FY 2000 are deter mined, over or under recoveries may be included
as an adjustment to the next rate negotiation to recover the difference
between the FY 2000 estimated costs used to establish the fixed rates and
the negotiated FY 2000 actual costs.

D.  CARRY-FORWARD AMOUNTS: The fixed rates set forth in Section I of this
agreement are inclusive of estimated FY98 carry-forward amounts as follows:

                                               Estimated FY98
      Rate                            Institute Under / (Over) Recovery
      SAO G&A                                   ($430,000)
      SAO Direct Operating Overhead              $283,742
      SAO Material Overhead                     ($ 47,086)
      SAO Central Engineering Overhead          ($  6,250)
      SAO Leave                                 ($ 40,325)

E. USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:   The rates set forth in SECTION I hereof
were negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB
Circular A-122. Accordingly, such rates shall be applied, to the extent
provided in such circular, to grants and contracts to which OMB Circular
A-122 is applicable, subject to any limitations in part A of this section.
Copies of this document may be provided by either party to other Federal
agencies which have or intend to issue or award grants and/or contracts to
the Smithsonian Institution to use the stated rates or to otherwise provide
such agencies with documentary notice of this agreement and its terms and
conditions.
              
F.  SPECIAL REMARKS:  The Government's agreement with these rates is not
an acceptance of the institution's accounting systems, cost
classifications, allocation methodologies, and the reasonableness of any
specific proposed costs.
