A.  LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I of this agreement is
expressly subject to any statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable
to a given grant, contract, or other agreement only to the extent that funds are
available and consistent with any and all limitations of cost clauses or provisions,
if any, contained therein.  Acceptance of any or all of the rates agreed to herein
is predicated upon all the following conditions: (1) that no costs other than those
incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in its indirect cost pool as
finally accepted and that all such costs are legal obligations of the grantee/
contractor and allowable under the governing and applicable cost principles; (2)
that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as
direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs have been accorded consistent
accounting treatment; and (4) that the information provided by the contractor/
grantee, which was used as the basis for the acceptance of the rate(s) agreed to
herein and expressly relied upon by the Government in negotiating and accepting
the said rates, is not subsequently found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The predetermined rates contained in Section I of this
agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at the time this agreement
was negotiated. Changes to the method(s) of accounting for costs which affects
the amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates requires the
express and written approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant
negotiating agency for the Government prior to implementation of any such changes.
Such changes include but are not limited to changes in the charging of a
particular type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure on the part of the
grantee/contractor to obtain the required approval may result in subsequent cost
disallowances.

C.  PREDETERMINED FIXED RATES: The predetermined rates contained in this agreement
are not subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular
A-21, subject to the limitations contained in Part A of this section.

D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES: The rates set forth in SECTION I hereof were
negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB Circular
A-21. Accordingly, such rates shall be applied, to the extent provided in such
circular, to grants and contracts to which OMB Circular A-21 is applicable,
subject to any limitations in part A of this section. Copies of this document
may be provided by either party to other Federal agencies which have or intend
to issue or award grants and/or contracts to Lehigh University to use the
stated rates or to otherwise provide such agencies with documentary notice of
this agreement and its terms and conditions.

E.  DFARS WAIVER: Signature of this agreement by the authorized representatives
of Lehigh University and the Government, acknowledges and affirms the
University's request for waiver of the prohibition contained in DFARS
231.303(1) and the Government's  exercise of its discretion under DFARS
231.303(2) to waive the prohibition in DFARS  231.303(1).  The waiver request
by Lehigh University is made to simplify the Institute's overall management
of DOD cost reimbursements under DOD contracts.
