A.  LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I of this agreement is
expressly subject to any statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable to a
given grant, contract, or other agreement only to the extent that funds are available
and consistent with any and all limitations of cost clauses or provisions, if any,
contained therein.  Acceptance of any or all of the rates agreed to herein is
predicated upon all the following conditions: (1) that no costs other than those
incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in its indirect cost pool as finally
accepted and that all such costs are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and
allowable under the governing and applicable cost principles; (2) that the same costs
that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that
similar types of costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4)
that the information provided by the contractor/grantee, which was used as the basis
for the acceptance of the rate(s) agreed to herein and expressly relied upon by the
Government in negotiating and accepting the said rates, is not subsequently found to
be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The predetermined rates contained in Section I of this
agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at the time this agreement was
negotiated. Changes to the method(s) of accounting for costs which affects the amount
of reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates requires the express and
written approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant negotiating
agency for the Government prior to implementation of any such changes.  Such changes
include but are not limited to changes in the charging of a particular type of cost 
from indirect to direct.  Failure on the part of the grantee/contractor to obtain
the required approval may result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C.  PREDETERMINED FIXED RATES: The predetermined rates contained in this agreement
are not subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21,
subject to the limitations contained in Part A of this section.

D. FIXED RATES : The fixed rates in this agreement are based on estimates of costs
for Fiscal Years 2000 and 2001. When the actual costs for each  period is determined,
an adjustment will be made to the rate of a future year to recognize the difference
between the estimated cost used to establish the respective year's fixed rate and the
negotiated actual costs. A carry-forward amount will be determined for each
fiscal year .

E.  DFARS WAIVER: Signature of this agreement by the authorized representatives of
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the Government, acknowledges and affirms the
Institute's request for waiver of the prohibition contained in DFARS  231.303(1)
and the Government's  exercise of its discretion under DFARS  231.303(2) to waive
the prohibition in DFARS  231.303(1).  The waiver request by Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute is made to simplify the Institute's overall
management of DOD cost reimbursements under DOD contracts.

F.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES: The rates set forth in Section I hereof were
negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB Circular
A-21. Accordingly, such rates shall be applied, to the extent provided in such
