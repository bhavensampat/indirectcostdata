          (2)  Applies only to DoD contracts awarded on or after

DFARS 231.303(1).  See Section II, Part C, hereof.  

SECTION II - GENERAL                                                    

A.   LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I
is subject to any statutory or administrative limitations and
is applicable to a given grant or contract only to the extent that
funds are available.  Acceptance of the rates agreed to herein is
predicated upon all of the following conditions: (1) that no costs
other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were included
in this indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that such costs
are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under
governing cost principles, (2) that the same costs that have been
treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs, (3) that
similar types of costs have been accorded consistent accounting
treatment, and (4) that the information provided by the grantee/
contractor which was used as a basis for acceptance of the rates
agreed to herein, and expressly relied upon by the Government in
negotiating and accepting the said rates is not subsequently
found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.          

B.   ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The rates contained in Section I of this
agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at the time
the agreement was negotiated.  Changes to the method(s) of
accounting for costs which affect the amount of reimbursement
resulting from the use of these rates require the prior approval
of the authorized representative of the cognizant negotiation
agency.  Such changes include but are not limited to changes in
the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct.
Failure to obtain such approval may result in subsequent cost
disallowances.

C.   PREDETERMINED RATES:  The predetermined rates contained in
this agreement are not subject to adjustment in accordance with
the provisions of OMB Circular A-21, subject to the limitations
contained in Part A of this Section.

D.   FIXED RATES WITH CARRYFORWARD PROVISIONS:   

     1.   This type of rate is considered final and not subject
to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular
A-21 and the Federal Acquisition Regulation, subject to the
limitations contained in Part A of this Section; except that
the difference between the estimated costs and the actual costs
of the period covered by the rate is carried forward as an
adjustment to the rate computation of a subsequent period as
discussed below.

     2.   The FY 2001 Fringe Benefit rates contained in this
agreement are based on estimates of the costs for FY 2001.
When actual costs for this period are determined, adjustments
will be applied to the next subsequent rate negotiation to
compensate for the difference between the estimated FY 2001
costs used to establish the fixed rates with carryforward
provisions and the negotiated actual FY 2001 costs.

E.   LIQUIDATION OF PRIOR YEAR CARRYFORWARD AMOUNTS: Shown
below are the actual  FY 1999 carryforward amounts that are
being liquidated through the FY 2001 rates set forth above:

FY99      $335,890 (O)   $233,415 (O)   $569,305 (O)

                  FRINGE BENEFITS

1.   The FY 2001 "Full Fringe Benefit" rate set forth above includes
the liquidation of the actual over-recovery amount of $347,300 from
FY 99. 

2.   The FY 2001 "Partial Fringe Benefit" rate set forth above
includes the liquidation of the actual over-recovery amount of
$12,059 from FY 99. 

F.   USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in
Section I were negotiated in accordance with and under the
authority set forth in OMB Circular A-21.  Accordingly, such
rates shall be applied to the extent provided in such Circular
to grants and contracts to which OMB Circular A-21 applies,
subject to any limitations in part A of this section.  Copies of
this document may be provided by either party to other federal
agencies which have or intend to issue or award sponsored
agreements using these rates or to otherwise provide such
agencies with documentary notice of this agreement and its
terms and conditions.

G.   APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DoD CONTRACTS/
SUBCONTRACTS:  In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation
(unless waived by the institution) may be placed on the
reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred
by an institution of higher education under a DOD contract
awarded on or after November 30, 1993, unless the same
limitation is applied uniformly to all other organizations
performing similar work.  It has been determined by the
Department of Defense that such limitation is not being
uniformly applied.  Accordingly, the rates cited (2) of
Section I, as explained under the title "APPLICABLE TO"
do not reflect the application of the 26% limitation on
administrative indirect costs imposed by OMB Circular
A-21 whereas (1) does so.

H.   SPECIAL REMARKS: The purpose of this agreement is
to establish predetermined F&A rates and fixed with
carryforward provisions Fringe Benefit rates for the
period 1 July 2000 through 30 June 2001.  These rates
are based on GIT/RI's   proposal dated 7 April 2000
and the establishment of these rates by the Government
based on the accounting systems and allocation
methodologies contained in this proposal does not
represent an agreement that these systems and
methodologies are accepted for fiscal year 2001, or
for any subsequent year's rate negotiation.  The
recommendations of the Defense Contract Audit Agency,
Atlanta Branch in Audit Reports # 1101-2000T23000003
were considered in the negotiation of these rates.
