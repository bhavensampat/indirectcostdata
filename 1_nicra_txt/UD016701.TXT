SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

A.   LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is subject to any
statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable to a given grant,
contract or other agreement only to the extent that funds are available and
consistent with any and all limitations of cost clauses or provisions, if any,
contained therein.  Acceptance of the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon
all of the following conditions: (1) that no costs other than those incurred by
the grantee/contractor were included in this indirect cost pool as finally
accepted and that such costs are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor
and allowable under governing cost principles; (2) that the same costs that
have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that
similar types of costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and
(4) that the information provided by the grantee/contractor, which was used as
the basis for acceptance of the rates agreed to herein and expressly relied
upon by the Government in negotiating and accepting the said rates, is not
subsequently found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.   ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The rates contained in Section I of this agreement
are based on the accounting system in effect at the time the agreement was
negotiated.  Changes to the method(s) of accounting for costs which affect
the amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates require
the written approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant
negotiating agency for the Government prior to implementation of any such
changes.  Such changes include but are not limited to changes in the
charging of a particular type of costs from indirect to direct.  Failure
to obtain such approval may result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C.   PREDETERMINED RATES: The predetermined rates set forth in Section I
of this agreement are not subject to adjustment in accordance with the
provisions of OMB Circular A-21, subject to the limitations contained in
Part A of this section.

D.   FIXED RATES AND CARRY-FORWARD PROVISIONS: The fixed rates set forth
in Section I of this agreement are based on estimates of the costs for
FY 2001.  When actual costs for this period is determined, an adjustment
will be made to the rates of a future year to recognize the difference
between the FY 2001 estimated costs used to establish the fixed rates
and the negotiated actual FY 2001 costs.

E.  CARRY-FORWARD AMOUNTS: The rates set forth in Section I of this
agreement are inclusive of carry-forward amounts as follows:

F.    APPLICATION OF FACILITY & ADMINISTRATIVE COST RATES TO DoD CONTRACTS/
SUBCONTRACTS: 

     1.  Signature of this agreement by the authorized representative of the
University of Denver and the Government acknowledges and affirms the
University's request to waive the prohibition contained in DFARS 231.303(1)
except for the DRI On Campus Organized Research rates (see paragraph F.2.
below) and the Government's exercise of its discretion contained in DFARS
231.303(2) to waive the prohibition in DFARS 231.303(1).  The waiver
request by the University of Denver is made to simplify the University's
overall management of DOD cost reimbursements under DOD contracts.

     2.  In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless waived by
the institution) may be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable
indirect costs incurred by an institution of higher education under a DoD
contract awarded on or after November 30, 1993, unless the same limitation
is applied uniformly to all other organizations performing similar work.
It has been determined by DoD that such limitation is not being uniformly
applied.  Accordingly, the DRI On Campus Organized Research rates cited
(2) of Section I, as explained under the title "APPLICABLE TO" (2), do
not reflect the application of the 26% limitation on administrative
indirect costs imposed by OMB Circular A-21 where as (1) does.

G.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in Section
Ihereof were negotiated in accordance with and under the authority
set forth in OMB Circular A-21.  Accordingly, such rates shall be
applied to the extent provided in such circular to grants and 
contracts to which OMB Circular A-21 is applicable, subject to any
limitations in part A of this section.  Copies of this document may
be provided by either party to other Federal agencies which have or
intend to issue or award grants and contracts using these rates or
to otherwise provide such agencies with documentary notice of this
agreement and its terms and conditions.
