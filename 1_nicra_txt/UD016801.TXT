SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

A.   LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is subject
to any statutory or administrative limitations, and is applicable to a
given grant, contract or other agreement only to the extent that funds
are available and consistent with any and all limitations of cost clauses
or provisions, if any, contained therein.  Acceptance of the rates agreed
to herein is predicated upon all the following conditions: (1) that no
costs other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in
the indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that all such costs are
legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under governing
cost principles; (2) that the same costs that have been treated as indirect
costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs have
been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) that the information
provided by the contractor/grantee, which was used as the basis for the
acceptance of the rates agreed to herein and expressly relied upon by the
Government in negotiating and accepting the said rates, is not subsequently
found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.   ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The rates contained in Section I of this agreement
are based on the accounting system in effect at the time this agreement was
negotiated, except as noted in paragraph D below. Changes to the method(s)
of accounting for costs which affects the amount of reimbursement resulting
from the use of these rates require the written approval of the authorized
representative of the cognizant negotiating agency.  Such changes include
but are not limited to changes in the charging of a particular type of cost
from indirect to direct.  Failure to obtain such approval may result in
subsequent cost disallowances.

C.   USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES: The rates set forth in Section I hereof
were negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB
Circular A-21.  Accordingly, such rates shall be applied to the extent
provided in such circular to grants and contracts to which OMB Circular A-21
applies, subject to any limitations in paragraph A above.  Copies of this
document may be provided by either party to other Federal agencies which
have or intend to issue or award grants and contracts using these rates as a
means of providing them with early notification of the agreement contained
herein.

D.   PREDETERMINED RATES: The predetermined rates set forth in Section I of
this agreement are not subject to adjustment in accordance with the
provisions of OMB Circular A-21, subject to the limitations contained in
Part A of this section.

E.   DFARS WAIVER: Signature of this agreement by the authorized
representative of the University of Delaware and the Government
acknowledges and affirms the University's request to waive the
prohibition contained in DFARS 231.303(1) and the Government's
exercise of its discretion contained in DFARS 231.303(2) to waive the
prohibition in DFARS 231.303(1).  The waiver request by the University
of Delaware is made to simplify the University's overall management of
DOD cost reimbursements under DOD contracts.

F. SPECIAL REMARKS:

	1.  Off Campus Definition - For all activities performed in
facilities not owned by the institution, the off campus rate will apply.

project is performed off campus, the off campus rate will apply to the
entire project.

means an article of nonexpendable tangible personal property having a
useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $500 or
more per unit. Effective 1 July 1997, the acquisition cost of
