SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                                                                  
A.  LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I of this agreement is
expressly subject to any statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable
to a given grant, contract, or other agreement only to the extent that funds are
available and consistent with any and all limitations of cost clauses or provisions,
if any, contained therein.  Acceptance of any or all of the rates agreed to herein
is predicated upon all the following conditions: (1) that no costs other than those
incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in its indirect cost pool as finally
accepted and that all such costs are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and
allowable under the governing and applicable cost principles; (2) that the same costs
that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that
similar types of costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4)
that the information provided by the contractor/grantee, which was used as the basis
for the acceptance of the rate(s) agreed to herein and expressly relied upon by the
Government accepting the said rates, is not subsequently found to be materially in-
complete or inaccurate.

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The rates contained in Section I of this agreement are based
on the accounting system in effect at the time this agreement was established.
Changes to the method(s) of accounting for costs which affects the amount of
reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates requires the express and written
approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant negotiating agency for the
Government prior to implementation of any such changes.  Such changes include but are
not limited to changes in the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to
direct.  Failure on the part of the grantee/contractor to obtain the required
approval may result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C. PREDETERMINED RATES: The predetermined indirect cost rate contained in this
agreement is not subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of OMB
Circular A-21, subject to the limitations contained in Part A of this section.

D. FIXED RATES: The fixed rates in this agreement are based on estimates of the costs
for FY 2001.  When actual costs for the periods are determined, an adjustment will be
made to the rates of a future year to recognize the difference between the FY 2001
estimated costs used to establish the fixed rates and the negotiated actual FY 2001
costs.
