SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

A.  LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is subject
to any statutory or administrative limitations, and is applicable to a
given grant, contract or other agreement only to the extent that funds are
available and consistent with any and all limitations of cost clauses or
provisions, if any, contained therein.  Acceptance of the rates agreed to
herein is predicated upon all the following conditions: (1) that no costs
other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in the
indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that all such costs are legal
obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under governing cost
principles; (2) that the same costs that have been treated as indirect
costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs
have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) that the
information provided by the contractor/grantee, which was used as the
basis for the acceptance of the rates agreed to herein and expressly
relied upon by the Government in negotiating and accepting the said rates,
is not subsequently found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.   ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The rates contained in Section I of this agreement
are based on the accounting system in effect at the time this agreement was
negotiated, except as noted in paragraph D below. Changes to the method(s)
of accounting for costs which affects the amount of reimbursement resulting
from the use of these rates require the written approval of the authorized
representative of the cognizant negotiating agency.  Such changes include
but are not limited to changes in the charging of a particular type of cost
from indirect to direct.  Failure to obtain such approval may result in
subsequent cost disallowances.

C.   USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES: The rates set forth in Section I hereof
were negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB
Circular A-21.  Accordingly, such rates shall be applied to the extent
provided in such circular to grants and contracts to which OMB Circular A-21
applies, subject to any limitations in paragraph A above.  Copies of this
document may be provided by either party to other Federal agencies which
have or intend to issue or award grants and contracts using these rates as
a means of providing them with early notification of the agreement contained
herein.

D.   QUALIFICATIONS:  The parties have agreed to these rates with the
following understanding:

	1) The Government's agreement with these rates is not an acceptance
of Stanford's accounting systems, allocation methodologies, cost analysis
studies, and carry-forwards from past years relative to the FY 2001 and 2002
proposals.

	2) The Government's use, during these negotiations, of any data
submitted by Stanford from a cost analysis study in support of its proposals,
either completed or partially completed, shall not be considered as acceptance
or pre-approval of such study.

	3) Furthermore, the parties agree this rate agreement for Stanford's
FY 2001 and 2002 facilities and administrative cost and FY 2001 fringe benefits
rates will not be cited by either party for purposes other than as a rate
agreement between the parties on Stanford facilities and administrative cost
and fringe benefits rates for FY 2001 and FY 2002.
	
	4) Stanford is not making any concessions or admissions about the
allowability of any costs.  By agreeing to accept less than its proposed costs
in these rates, Stanford is not stating or implying that any costs were ever
unallowable or inappropriate, nor is it agreeing to a similar treatment of
these costs in the future.

E.  FIXED FRINGE BENEFITS RATES AND CARRY-FORWARD PROVISION: The Fringe
Benefits rates contained in this agreement are based on estimates of the
costs for FY 2001.  When the actual costs for FY 2001 are determined,
adjustments may be made to the rates of a future year to recognize the
difference between the FY 2001 estimated costs used to establish the fixed
rates and the negotiated actual FY 2001 costs.

F.  PREDETERMINED FACILITIES & ADMINISTRATIVE COST RATES: The predetermined
facilities and administrative cost rates for FY 2001 and FY 2002 contained
in this agreement are subject only to adjustment in accordance with the
provisions of OMB Circular A-21.

G.  CARRY-FORWARD AMOUNTS: The Fringe Benefits rates contained in this
agreement are inclusive of the FY 1999 carry-forwards established by
Negotiation Agreement dated 7 June 2000.  Accordingly, the FY 1999
carry-forwards are liquidated in their entirety:

FY 1999 Fringe Benefits Carry-Forwards	  University Under / (Over) Recovery
Regular Benefits - Eligible Employees	  $1,201,000
Post-Doctoral Research Affiliates	  $   47,000
Contingent Employees			  $   19,000

H.  DFARS WAIVER: Signature of this agreement by the authorized representative
of Stanford University and the Government acknowledges and affirms the
University's request to waive the prohibition contained in DFARS 231.303(1)
and the Government's exercise of its discretion contained in DFARS 231.303(2)
to waive the prohibition in DFARS 231.303(1).  The waiver request by Stanford
University is made to simplify the University's overall management of DOD cost
reimbursements under DOD contracts.

The undersigned hereby declare that the terms of this document have been
completely read and are fully understood and voluntarily accepted.

The individuals executing this agreement are authorized to execute for and on
behalf of the parties for whom they sign and do so as their free and voluntary
act.
