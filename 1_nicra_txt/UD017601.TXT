SECTION II: GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

A.  LIMITATION: Use of the rates set forth in Section I is  subject to any statutory or
administrative limitations and is applicable to a given grant, contract, or other
agreement only to the extent that funds are available and consistent with any and all
limitations of cost clauses or provisions, if any, contained therein.   Acceptance of
any or all of the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon all the following
conditions: (1) that no costs other than those incurred by the contractor/grantee
were included in its indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that all such costs
are legal obligations of the contractor/grantee and allowable under governing cost
principles; (2) that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not
claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs have been accorded
consistent accounting treatment; and (4) the information provided by the contractor/
grantee,  which was used as the basis for acceptance of the rates agreed to herein
and expressly relied upon by the Government in negotiating the said rates, is not
subsequently found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B  ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The rates contained in Section I of this agreement are based on
the accounting system in effect at the time this agreement was negotiated.  Changes to
the method(s) of accounting for costs, which affect the amount of reimbursement
resulting from the use of these rates, require the written approval of the authorized
representative of the cognizant negotiating agency for the Government prior to
implementation of any such changes.  Such changes include, but are not limited to,
changes in the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct.
Failure to obtain such approval may result in a subsequent cost disallowance.

C.  FIXED RATES AND CARRYFORWARD PROVISIONS: The fixed rates contained in this agreement
are based on estimates of costs for FY 2001. When actual costs for this fiscal year are
determined, adjustments will be applied to the next subsequent rate negotiation to
recognize the difference between the FY 2001 estimated costs used to establish the
fixed rates and the negotiated actual FY 2001 costs.

D. CARRYFORWARD AMOUNTS:

1.  The Leave Benefit Rates set forward in Section I of this agreement are inclusive of
estimated carryforward adjustments from 1999. After negotiation and finalization of the
FY 1999 actual costs, any difference between the FY 1999 estimated carryforward amounts
used to establish the FY 2001 Leave Benefit Rates and the actual FY 1999 carryforward
amounts shall be included as an adjustment to the next subsequent rate negotiation.   

   Leave Benefit Rates FY 1999 Carryforward: $(283,336) 

2. The Staff Benefit Rates set forward in Section I of this agreement are inclusive of
a portion of the net carryforward amounts from FY 1998 and FY 1999. The University did
not claim the FY 1998 carryforward when it proposed the FY 2000 Fringe Benefit Rates,
instead they netted the 1998 underrecovery amount of $ 1,763,934 with the FY 1999
overrecovery amount of $1,237,999, and are proposing to amortize the net underrecovery
of $525,935 over three years, FY 2001, FY 2002 and FY 2003. Thus, the amount of
carryforward included in these rates is:

       Staff Benefit Rates FY 1998 Carryforward:  $  1,763,934
                           FY 1999 Carryforward:  $ (1,237,999)
                               Net-Carryforward:  $     525,935
    Amount included in FY 2001 Rates              $     175,312
    Amount remaining to be liquidated             $     350,623	

(O) Denotes Over-recovery

E.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES: The rates set forth in Section I hereof  were
negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB Circular
A-21.  Accordingly, such rates shall be applied to the extent provided in such
Circular to grants, contracts and other agreements to which OMB Circular A-21 is
applicable, subject to any limitations in part A of this section.  Copies of this
document may be provided by either party to other Federal agencies which have or
intend to issue or award grants and contracts using these rates or to otherwise
provide such agencies with documentary notice of this agreement and its terms and
conditions.

by signature in the space provided below.  The terms of this agreement are subject
to all regulations and statutes applicable to any contract, grant or other
agreement that includes the provisions of OMB Circular A-21.  The terms of this
agreement will not change any monetary ceilings or statutory limitations of any
individual Federal contract, grant, or other agreement with the University of
Alaska.
