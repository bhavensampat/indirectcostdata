                                         DISTRIBUTION BASE
          
(a)  Modified Total Direct Costs consisting of salaries and wages, fringe benefits,
materials and supplies, services, travel, and subgrants and subcontracts up to the
first $25,000 of each subgrant or subcontract (regardless of the period covered by
the subgrant or subcontract).  Equipment (defined as having a useful life of over
one year, and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more per unit), capital expenditures,
charges for patient care and tuition remission, rental costs, scholarships and 
fellowships, as well as the portion of each subgrant and subcontract in excess of
$25,000 shall be excluded from modified total direct costs.

(b)  Salaries and wages of graduate assistants with tuition waivers (for purpose of
assessing tuition waivers).

                                          Applicable To

(1)  Applies to all DoD contracts and subcontracts awarded or issued before
     November 30, 1993, all Non-DoD instruments, and all DoD grants.  See 
     Section II, Part F hereof.
 
(2)  Applies to all DoD contracts awarded or issued on or after November 30, 1993 in
     accordance with and under the authority of DFARS 231.303(1).  See Section II,
     Part F hereof.

SECTION II - GENERAL                                                    

A.  LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I is subject to any statutory
or administrative limitations and is applicable to a given grant or contract only to the
extent that funds are available and consistent with any and all limitations of cost
clauses or provisions, if any, contained therein.  Acceptance of the rates agreed to
herein is predicated upon all of the following conditions: (1) that no costs other than
those incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in this indirect cost pool as
finally accepted and that such costs are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor
and allowable under governing cost principles, (2) that the same costs that have been
treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs, (3) that similar types of
costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment, and (4) that the information
provided by the grantee/contractor which was used as a basis for acceptance of the rates
agreed to herein, and expressly relied upon by the Government in negotiating and
accepting the said rates is not subsequently found to be materially incomplete or
inaccurate.          

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The rates contained in Section I of this agreement are based
on the accounting system in effect at the time the agreement was negotiated.  Changes to
the method(s) of accounting for costs which affect the amount of reimbursement resulting
from the use of these rates require the written approval of the authorized
representative of the cognizant negotiation agency for the Government prior to
implementation of any such changes.  Such changes include but are not limited to
changes in the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure
to obtain such approval may result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C.  PREDETERMINED RATES: This type of rate is considered final, and not subject to
adjustment in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21 and the Federal
Acquisition regulation, subject to the limitations contained in Part A of this
Section.

D.  PROVISIONAL RATES:  The provisional rates contained in this agreement are subject
to unilateral amendment by the Government or bilateral amendment by the contracting
parties at any time.

E.  SPECIAL REMARKS:   For awards made prior to 7/1/2000, UIC will not assess F&A costs
to equipment purchases over $500.

F.  APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DOD CONTRACTS/ SUBCONTRACTS:  In accordance
with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless waived by the institution) may be placed on
the reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred by an institution of
higher education under a DoD contract awarded on or after November 30, 1993, unless
the same limitation is applied uniformly to all other organizations performing similar
work.  It has been determined by the Department of Defense that such limitation is not
being uniformly applied.  Accordingly, the rates cited (2) of Section I, as explained
under title AAPPLICABLE TO@ (2), do not reflect the application of the 26% limitation
on administrative indirect costs imposed by OMB A-21, whereas (1) does so.

G.	USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in Section I were
negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB Circular A-21.
Accordingly, such rates shall be applied to the extent provided in such Circular to
grants and contracts to which OMB Circular A-21 applies, subject to any limitations
in part A of this section.  Copies of this document may be provided by either party
to other federal agencies which have or intend to issue or award sponsored agreements
using these rates or to otherwise provide such agencies with documentary notice of this
agreement and its terms and conditions.
