(2)   Applies only to DOD contracts awarded on or after November 30, 1993 in accordance
      with and under the authority of DFARS  231.303 (1).  (Uncapped)

SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                                                                       
A.  LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I of this agreement is
expressly subject to any statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable to
a given grant, contract, or other agreement only to the extent that funds are
available and consistent with any and all limitations of cost clauses or provisions,
if any, contained therein.  Acceptance of any or all of the rates agreed to herein
is predicated upon all the following conditions: (1) that no costs other than those
incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in its indirect cost pool as finally
accepted and that all such costs are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and
allowable under the governing and applicable cost principles; (2) that the same costs
that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that
similar types of costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4)
that the information provided by the contractor/grantee, which was used as the basis
for the acceptance of the rate(s) agreed to herein and expressly relied upon by the
Government in negotiating and accepting the said rates, is not subsequently found to
be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The rates contained in Section I of this agreement are based
on the accounting system in effect at the time this agreement was negotiated. Changes
to the method(s) of accounting for costs which affects the amount of reimbursement
resulting from the use of these rates requires the express and written approval of
the authorized representative of the cognizant negotiating agency for the Government
prior to implementation of any such changes.  Such changes include but are not
limited to changes in the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to
direct.  Failure on the part of the grantee/contractor to obtain the required
approval may result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C.  FIXED WITH CARRY-FORWARD RATES:   The fixed rates contained in this agreement
are based on estimates of the costs for FY 2001. When actual costs for this fiscal
year are determined, adjustments will be applied to the next subsequent rate
negotiation to recognize the difference between the FY 2001 estimated costs used
to establish the fixed rates and the negotiated actual FY 2001 costs. 

D. PROVISIONAL RATES:  The provisional rates contained in this agreement are subject
to unilateral amendment by the Government or bilateral amendment by the contracting
parties at any time. 

E. OFF- CAMPUS:  A project is considered off-campus if the activity is conducted at
locations other than in university owned or supported facilities and indirect costs
associated with physical plant and/or library are not considered applicable to the
project.

F.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES: The rates set forth in Section I hereof were
negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB Circular
A-21. Accordingly, such rates shall be applied, to the extent provided in such
circular, to grants and contracts to which OMB Circular A-21 is applicable,
subject to any limitations in part A of this section. Copies of this document
may be provided by either party to other Federal agencies which have or intend
to issue or award grants and/or contracts to Utah State University to use the
stated rates or to otherwise provide such agencies with documentary notice of
this agreement and its terms and conditions.

G.  APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DOD CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS:

1. Research and Instruction Functions:

In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless waived by the
institution) may be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable
indirect costs incurred by an institution of higher education under a DOD
contract awarded on or after November 30, 1993, unless the same limitation is
applied uniformly to all other organizations performing similar work.  It has
been determined by the Department of Defense that such limitation is not
being uniformly applied.  Accordingly, the rates cited (2) of Section I, as
explained under the title "APPLICABLE TO" do not reflect the application of
the 26% limitation on administrative indirect costs imposed by OMB Circular
A-21, whereas (1) does so.

2. Other Sponsored Activity:

Signature of this agreement by the authorized representative of Utah State
University and the Government acknowledges and affirms the University's
request to waive the prohibition contained in DFARS 231.303(1) and the
Government's exercise of its discretion contained in DFARS 231.303(2) to
waive the prohibition in DFARS 231.303(1). The waiver requested by Utah
State University is made to simplify the University's overall management
of DOD cost reimbursements under DOD contracts.
