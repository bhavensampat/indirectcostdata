     (2)  Applies to only DoD contracts awarded on or after November 30, 1993
in accordance with and under the authority of DFARS 231.303(1).  See Section II,
Part F hereof.

                                                                  
SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                                                                  

A. LIMITATIONS: Use of the rates set forth under Section I is subject to any
statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable to a given grant,
contract or other agreement only to the extent that funds are available and
consistent with any and all limitations of cost clauses or provisions, if any,
contained therein.  Acceptance of any or all of the rates agreed to herein is
predicated upon all the following conditions: (1) that no costs other than those
incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in its indirect cost pool as
finally accepted and that all such costs are legal obligations of the
grantee/contractor and allowable under governing cost principles; (2) that the
same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct
costs; (3) that similar types of costs, in like circumstances, have been accorded
consistent accounting treatment; and (4) that the information provided by the
contractor/grantee, which was used as the basis for the acceptance of the rates
agreed to herein and expressly relied upon by the Government in negotiating the
said rates, is not subsequently found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.


B. ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The rates contained in Section I of this agreement are
based on the accounting system in effect at the time this agreement was
negotiated. Changes to the method(s) of accounting for costs, which affects the
amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates, require the
written approval of the authorized representative of 
the cognizant negotiating agency for the Government prior to implementation of
any such changes.  Such changes include but are not limited to changes in the
charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure to obtain
such approval may result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C. FIXED RATES WITH CARRY-FORWARD PROVISIONS:  The fixed rates contained in this
agreement are based on estimates of the costs for FY 2001. When actual costs for
this fiscal year are determined, adjustments will be applied to the next
subsequent rate negotiation to recognize the difference between the FY 2001
estimated costs used to establish the fixed rates and the negotiated actual FY
2001 costs. 

D. PREDETERMINED RATES:  The predetermined rates contained in this agreement are
not subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21,
subject to the limitations contained in Part A of this section. 

E. CARRY-FORWARD AMOUNTS:     

The following carryforward amounts were considered in the
establishing the FY 2001 rates:

                           FY 1998         FY 1999

Student Wages                                     -

Note (a): The FY 1998 carry-forward amount represents the
difference between the final negotiated FY 1998 carry-forward
amount and the estimated carry-forward amount included in the FY
2000 fixed rate.

Note (b): The estimated FY 1999 carry-forward amounts will be
included in the FY 2001 rates. After the FY 1999 rates are
finalized, any difference between the estimated FY 1999 carry-
forward amount and the actual carry-forward amount will be included
as an adjustment in a subsequent year rate negotiation.

Note (c): Of the estimated FY 1999 under-recovery of $1,485,764 at
the Weis Research Center, the parties agreed that $1,262,899 will
be considered in the FY 2001 Hershey Medical Center rate. The
remaining amount of $222,864 should be allocated to and considered
in the Geisinger Health System rates.
 
( ) Denotes over-recovery

F. APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DoD CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS:  In
accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless waived by the
institution) may be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable
indirect costs incurred by an institution of higher education under a DOD
contract awarded on or after November 30, 1993, unless the same
limitation is applied uniformly to all other organizations performing
similar work.  It has been determined by the Department of Defense that
such limitation is not being uniformly applied.  Accordingly, the rates
cited (2) of Section I, as explained under the title "APPLICABLE TO" (2),
do not reflect the application of the 26% limitation on administrative
indirect costs imposed by OMB Circular A-21 where as (1) does so.

G. USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in Section I
hereof were negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set
forth in OMB Circular A-21.  Accordingly, such rates shall be applied to
the extent provided in such circular to grants and contracts to which OMB
Circular A-21 is applicable, subject to any limitations in part A of this
section. Copies of this document may be provided by either party to other
Federal agencies which have or intend to issue or award grants and
contracts using these rates or to otherwise provide such agencies with
documentary notice of this agreement and its terms and conditions.
