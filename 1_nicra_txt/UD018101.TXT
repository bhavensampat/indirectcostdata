SECTION II: GENERAL

A.  LIMITATIONS: Use of the rates contained in this Agreement is subject to any
statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable  to a given grant or contract
only to the extent that funds are available.   Acceptance of the rates agreed to herein
is predicated upon  the following conditions:  (1) that no costs other than those
incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in this indirect cost pool as finally
accepted and that such costs are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and
allowable under governing cost principles: (2) that the same costs that have been
treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of
costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) that the information
provided by the grantee/contractor which was used  as a basis for acceptance of the
rates agreed to herein is not subsequently found to be materially incomplete or
inaccurate.

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The rates contained in this Agreement are based on
the accounting system in effect at the time the agreement was negotiated.  Changes to
the method of accounting for costs which affect the amount of reimbursement resulting
from the use of these rates require the prior approval of the authorized representative
of the cognizant negotiation agency.  Such changes include, but are not limited to
changes in the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure 
to obtain such approval may result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C.  FIXED RATES:  Each fixed rate in this agreement is based on an estimate of the
costs for the period covered by the rate.  When actual costs for this period are
determined, an adjustment may be made to a rate of a future year to recognize the
difference between the estimated costs used to establish the fixed rate and the
negotiated actual costs.

D.  PREDETERMINED RATES:  The predetermined rates contained in this agreement
are not subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21,
subject to the limitations contained in Part A of this Section.

E.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates contained herein were
negotiated in accordance with the authority set forth in OMB Circular A-21, and should
be applied to grants and contracts to which OMB Circular A-21 applies,  subject to any
limitations in paragraph A. above.  Copies of this document may be provided by the
Institution to other Federal Agencies having grants and contracts using these rates as a
means of providing them with early notification of the agreement contained herein.

F.  APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DOD CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS
In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless waived by the institution) may
be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred by an
institution of higher education under a DoD contract awarded on or after 
November 30, 1993, unless the same limitation is applied uniformly to all other 
organizations performing similar work.  It has been determined by the Department of
Defense that such limitation is not being uniformly applied.  Accordingly, the rates
cited (1) of Section I, as explained under title "APPLICABLE TO" (1), do not reflect
the  application of the 26% limitation on administrative indirect costs imposed by
OMB A-21, whereas (2) does so.


G.   LIQUIDATION OF PRIOR YEAR CARRYFORWARD (CFW) AMOUNTS

1.   F&A Rates:  The F&A rates set forth herein include adjustments for the following

recovery of $ 519,000 in FY 1999.  The FY 2001 Full Time rate of 24.80% set forth
herein includes an adjustment for the estimated  $ 519,000 over-recovery carryforward
amount.      

H.   QUALIFICATIONS; 

1.  The purpose of this agreement is to establish fixed F&A cost rates and 
fixed/predetermined Fringe Benefit rates for the period 1 July 2000 through 30 June
2001.  Rates established in Section I above are based on Carnegie Mellon University's
proposal dated 31 January 2000.  The establishment of these rates by the Government,
based on the accounting systems and allocation methodologies contained in this
proposal, does not represent an agreement that these systems and methodologies are
accepted for FY 2001, or for any subsequent fiscal year's rate negotiation.  The
recommendations of the Defense Contract Audit Agency, Pennsylvania Branch in Audit
Report No. 6701-2000G2300001 were considered during the negotiation of these rates. 
     
2.  Carnegie Mellon is not making any concession or admission about the
classification or allocation of certain costs,  nor is it agreeing to a similar
treatment of these costs in the future. Specifically, this clause addresses the
issue of classroom space and sponsored projects administration (SPA) costs.
Because the parties could not agree on these issues, Carnegie Mellon reserves
the right to continue to pursue the classification of classroom space and
allocation of the SPA costs.
