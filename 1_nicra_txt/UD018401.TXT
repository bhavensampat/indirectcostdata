SECTION II:  LIMITATIONS

A. LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I of this
agreement is expressly subject to any statutory or administrative
limitations and is applicable to a given grant, contact, or other
agreement only to the extent that funds are available and consistent
with any and all limitations of cost clauses or provisions, if any,
contained therein.  Acceptance of any or all of the rates agreed to
herein is predicated upon all the following conditions:  (1) that no
cost other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were included
in its indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that all such costs
are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under
the governing and applicable cost principles; (2) that the same costs
that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct
costs; (3) that similar types of costs have been accorded consistent
accounting treatment; and (4) that the information provided by the
contractor/grantee, which was used as the basis for the acceptance of
the rates agreed to herein and expressly relied upon by the Government
in accepting the said rates, is not subsequently found to be
materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The fixed rates contained in Section I of
this agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at the
time this agreement was issued.  Changes to the method(s) of
accounting for costs which affects the amount of reimbursement
resulting from the use of these rates requires the express and written
approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant negotiating
agency for the Government prior to implementation of any such changes.
Such changes include but are not limited to changes in the charging of
a particular type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure on the part
of the grantee/contractor to obtain the required approval may result
in subsequent cost disallowances.

C.  FIXED RATES WITH CARRY-FORWARD PROVISIONS:  The fixed rates contained
in this agreement are based on estimates of costs for FYs 2001 and 2002.
When actual costs for FYs 2001 and 2002 are determined, over or under
recoveries may be included as an adjustment to the next rate negotiations
to recover the difference between the FYs 2001 and 2002 estimated costs
use to establish the fixed rates and the negotiated FYs 2001-2002 actual
costs.

D.  CARRY-FORWARD AMOUNTS:  The fixed rates set forth in Section I of this
agreement are inclusive of carry-forward amounts as follows:


                            (Over)/Under Recovery

E.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in Section I
hereof were negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set
forth in OMB Circular A-122.  Accordingly, such rates shall be applied,
to the extent provided in such circular, to grants and contracts to
which OMB Circular A-122 is applicable, subject to any limitations
in part A of this section.  Copies of this document may be provided
by either party to other Federal agencies which have or intend to
issue or award grants and/or contracts to the Smithsonian Institution
to use the stated rates or to otherwise provide such agencies with
documentary notice of this agreement and its terms and conditions.  

F.  SPECIAL REMARKS:  The Government's agreement with these rates is
not an acceptance of the institution's accounting systems, cost
classifications, allocation methodologies, and the reasonableness of
any specific proposed costs.  Furthermore, this agreement does not
constitute acceptance of interest costs in conjunction with the
acquisition of the Victor Building, which will be determined after
the Government's receipt and review of the institution's lease
versus purchase study.
