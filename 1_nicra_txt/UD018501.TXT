      all salaries and wages, fringe benefits, materials and supplies, services,
      travel,  and subgrants and  subcontracts up to the first $25,000 of each
      subgrant or subcontract (regardless of the period covered by the subgrant or
      subcontract).  Equipment, capital expenditures, charges for patient care and
      tuition remission, rental costs, scholarships, and fellowships as well as the
      portion of each subgrant and subcontract in excess of $25,000 shall be
      excluded from modified total direct costs. 
                                           
SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                                                                      
A.  LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I of this agreement is
expressly subject to any statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable
to a given grant, contract, or other agreement only to the extent that funds are
available and consistent with any and all limitations of cost clauses or
provisions, if any, contained therein.  Acceptance of any or all of the rates
agreed to herein is predicated upon all the following conditions: (1) that no costs
other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in its indirect
cost pool as finally accepted and that all such costs are legal obligations of
the grantee/contractor and allowable under the governing and applicable cost
principles; (2) that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not
claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs have been accorded
consistent accounting treatment; and (4) that the information provided by
the contractor/grantee, which was used as the basis for the acceptance of the
rate(s) agreed to herein and expressly relied upon by the Government in negotiating
and accepting the said rates, is not subsequently found to be materially incomplete
or inaccurate.

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The predetermined rates contained in Section I of this
agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at the time this agreement
was negotiated. Changes to the method(s) of accounting for costs which affects the
amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates requires the express
and written approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant
negotiating agency for the Government prior to implementation of any such changes.
Such changes include but are not limited to changes in the charging of a particular
type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure on the part of the grantee/contractor
to obtain the required approval may result in subsequent cost
disallowances.

C.  PREDETERMINED FIXED RATES: The predetermined rates contained in this agreement
are not subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21,
subject to the limitations contained in Part A of this section.

D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES: The rates set forth in SECTION I hereof were
negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB Circular A-21.
Accordingly, such rates shall be applied, to the extent provided in such circular,
to grants and contracts to which OMB Circular A-21 is applicable, subject to any
limitations in part A of this section. Copies of this document may be provided by
either party to other Federal agencies which have or intend to issue or award grants
and/or contracts to Oklahoma State University to use the stated rates or to otherwise
provide such agencies with documentary notice of this agreement and its terms and
conditions.
              
E.  APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DOD CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS: In accordance
with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless waived by the Institution) may be placed
on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred by an institution
of higher education under a DOD contract award on or after November 30, 1993, unless
the same limitation is applied uniformly to all other organizations performing similar
work. It has been determined by the Department of Defense that such limitation is not
being uniformly applied. Accordingly, the rates cited (1) in Section I, as explained
under the title APPLICABLE TO (1), do not reflect the application of the 26% limitation
on administrative indirect costs imposed by OMB Circular A-21, whereas the rates cited
in (2) do so.
