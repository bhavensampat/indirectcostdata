SECTION II - GENERAL

A. LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rate set forth under Section I is subject to any statutory
or administrative limitations and is applicable to a given grant or contract only to
the extent that funds are available.  Acceptance of the rate agreed to herein is
predicated upon the following conditions: (l) that no costs other than those incurred
by the grantee/contractor were included in this indirect cost pool as finally accepted
and that such costs are legal obliations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under
governing cost principles; (2) that the same costs have been treated as indirect costs
are not claimed as direct costs (3) that similar types of costs have been accorded
consistent accounting treatment; and (4) that the information provided by the grantee/
contractor which was used as a basis for acceptance of the rate agreed to herein, and
expressly relied upon by the Government in negotiation and accepting the said rate, is
not subsequently found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B. ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The final rate contained in Section I of this agreement is based
on the accounting system in effect for CASA's FY 1999.  Changes to the method(s) of
accounting for costs which affect the amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of
this rate requires the prior approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant
negotiation agency.  Such changes include but are not limited to changes in the charging
of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure to obtain such approval
may result in subsequent cost disallowance.

C. USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rate set forth in Section I was negotiated in
accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB Circular A-122.  Accordingly,
such rate shall be applied to the extent provided in such Circular to grants, contracts
and other agreements to which OMB Circular A-122 applies, subject to any limitations in
part A of this section.  Copies of this document may be provided by either party to
other federal agencies which have or intend to issue or award sponsored agreements
using this rate or to otherwise provide such agencies with documentary notice of this
agreement and its terms and conditions.

D. The final rate set forth in this agreement is based on CASA's FY 1999 indirect cost
proposal dated 29 June 2000, and the Defense Contract Audit Agency Audit Report
No. 2211-2000A17900014 dated 12 December 2000.
