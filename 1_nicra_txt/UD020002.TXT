    with and under the authority of DFARS 231.303(1). See Section II, Paragraph E

SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

A.  LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I of this agreement is
expressly subject to any statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable
to a given grant, contract, or other agreement only to the extent that funds are
available and consistent with any and all limitations of cost clauses or provisions,
if any, contained therein.  Acceptance of any or all of the rates agreed to herein is
predicated upon all the following conditions: (1) that no costs other than those
incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in its indirect cost pool as finally
accepted and that all such costs are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and
allowable under the governing and applicable cost principles; (2) that the same costs
that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that
similar types of costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4)
that the information provided by the contractor/grantee, which was used as the basis
for the acceptance of the rate(s) agreed to herein and expressly relied upon by the
Government in negotiating and accepting the said rates, is not subsequently found to
be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The predetermined rates contained in Section I of this
agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at the time this agreement
was negotiated. Changes to the method(s) of accounting for costs which affects the
amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates requires the express
and written approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant negotiating
agency for the Government prior to implementation of any such changes.  Such changes
include but are not limited to changes in the charging of a particular type of cost
from indirect to direct.  Failure on the part of the grantee/contractor to obtain
the required approval may result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C.  PREDETERMINED RATES: The predetermined rates contained in this agreement are
not subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21,
subject to the limitations contained in Part A of this section.

D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES: The rates set forth in Section I  hereof were
negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB Circular
A-21. Accordingly, such rates shall be applied, to the extent provided in such
circular, to grants and contracts to which OMB Circular A-21 is applicable, subject
to any limitations in part A of this section. Copies of this document may be
provided by either party to other Federal agencies which have or intend to issue
or award grants and/or contracts to Mercer University to use the stated rates
or to otherwise provide such agencies with documentary notice of this agreement
and its terms and conditions.

E.  SPECIAL REMARKS

APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DOD CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS:  In accordance with
DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless waived by the institution) may be placed on
the reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred by an institution of
higher education under a DOD contract awarded on or after November 30, 1993, unless
the same limitation is applied uniformly to all other organizations performing
similar work.  It has been determined by the Department of Defense that such
limitation is not being uniformly applied.  Accordingly, the rates cited (2) of
Section I, as explained under the title "APPLICABLE TO" do not reflect the
application of the 26% limitation on administrative indirect costs imposed by OMB
Circular A-21 whereas (1) does so.
