SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                                                                       
A.  LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I of this agreement is
expressly subject to any statutory or administrative limitations and is
applicable to a given grant, contract, or other agreement only to the extent
that funds are available and consistent with any and all limitations of cost
clauses or provisions, if any, contained therein.  Acceptance of any or all of
the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon all the following conditions: (1)
that no costs other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were included
in its indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that all such costs are legal
obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under the governing and
applicable cost principles; (2) that the same costs that have been treated as
indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs
have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) that the information
provided by the contractor/grantee, which was used as the basis for the acceptance
of the rate(s) agreed to herein and expressly relied upon by the Government in
negotiating and accepting the said rates, is not subsequently found to be
materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The fixed rates contained in Section I of this agreement
are based on the accounting system in effect at the time this agreement was
negotiated. Changes to the method(s) of accounting for costs which affects the
amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates requires the
express and written approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant
negotiating agency for the Government prior to implementation of any such changes.
Such changes include but are not limited to changes in the charging of a
particular type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure on the
part of the grantee/contractor to obtain the required approval may result in
subsequent cost disallowance.

C.  FIXED RATES: The fixed rates contained in this agreement are based on estimates of
the costs for FY 2002. When the actual costs for FY 2002 are determined, any over or
under recoveries may be included as an adjustment to a subsequent rate negotiation to
recover the difference between the FY 2002 estimated costs used to establish the fixed
rates and the negotiated FY 2002 actual costs. 

D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES: The rates set forth in SECTION I hereof were
negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB Circular A-21.
Accordingly, such rates shall be applied, to the extent provided in such circular, to
grants and contracts to which OMB Circular A-21 is applicable, subject to any
limitations in part A of this section. Copies of this document may be provided by
either party to other Federal agencies which have or intend to issue or award grants
and/or contracts to Oklahoma State University to use the stated rates or to otherwise
provide such agencies with documentary notice of this agreement and its terms and
conditions.
              
E. SPECIAL REMARKS: The government?s agreement to these rates does not constitute
acceptance of the proposed accounting change included in the Oklahoma State University
proposal dated January 8, 2001, which establishes a new employee category
(Non-Retirement Faculty) for the Stillwater campus. The government?s approval or
disapproval will be determined upon completion of their review of the proposed change.
