SECTION II: GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

A.  LIMITATION: Use of the rates set forth in Section I is  subject to any statutory or
administrative limitations and is applicable to a given grant, contract, or other
agreement only to the extent that funds are available and consistent with any and all
limitations of cost clauses or provisions, if any, contained therein.   Acceptance of
any or all of the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon all the following
conditions: (1) that no costs other than those incurred by the contractor/grantee were
included in its indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that all such costs are
legal obligations of the contractor/grantee and allowable under governing cost
principles; (2) that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not
claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs have been accorded consistent
accounting treatment; and (4) the information provided by the contractor/grantee,
which was used as the basis for acceptance of the rates agreed to herein and expressly
relied upon by the Government in negotiating the said rates, is not subsequently found
to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B  ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The rates contained in Section I of this agreement are based on
the accounting system in effect at the time this agreement was negotiated.  Changes to
the method(s) of accounting for costs, which affect the amount of reimbursement
resulting from the use of these rates,  require the written approval of the authorized
representative of the cognizant negotiating agency for the Government prior to
implementation of any such changes.  Such changes include, but are not limited to,
changes in the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure
to obtain such approval may result in a  subsequent cost disallowance.

C.  FIXED RATES AND CARRYFORWARD PROVISIONS:

1.   This type of rate is considered final and not subject to adjustment in accordance
with the provisions of OMB circular A-21 and the Federal Acquisition Regulation,
subject to the limitations contained in Part A of this section, except that the
difference between the estimated costs and the actual costs of the period covered by
the rate is carried forward as an adjustment to the rate computation of a subsequent
period as discussed below.

2.  The rates contained in this agreement are based on estimates of the costs for
FY 2001.  When actual costs for this period are determined, adjustments will be
applied to the FY 2002 negotiated fixed rates to recognize the difference between the
estimated FY 2001 costs used to establish the fixed rates and the negotiated actual
FY 2001 costs.

3.  The Fringe Benefit rates set forth herein include the following estimated FY 2000
carryforward amounts:

Fringe Benefit 	    FY 00 Estimated	     Amount Liquidated

(U) Denotes Under-recovery

(*)  The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has established a self-insurance
trust fund for the purpose of paying workers= compensation claims for employees paid
from sponsored accounts.  It is understood and agreed that the university shall have
no right of recapture of the reserves in the self-insurance trust fund.  In the event
that the university terminates the self-insurance trust fund and purchases workers'
compensation insurance, any unencumbered reserves in the self-insurance trust fund
shall be used to pay the workers= compensation insurance premiums until such
reserves have been exhausted.

    As of 6/30/00 the self-insurance trust fund had a reserve balance of  $771,850.
The reserve balance is defined as the account balance less discounted liabilities
associated with claims currently being paid.  The $771,850 reserve balance is
expected to be reduced by approximately $70,647 in FY 2001, calculated as follows:
the sum of the actuarial funding recommendation at the mean confidence level, plus
administrative expense, less projected interest income, less income generated by
the nominal .01% rate assessment against the salary and wage base.  The university
believes that a minimum reserve balance of $500,000 is necessary in order to pay
routine workers' compensation claims plus such extraordinary claims as a death,
or two- three serious injuries in any given year. It is agreed that the university
will not increase the .01% rate unless the year-end reserve balance in the
self-insurance trust fund falls below $500,000.

D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in Section I hereof were
negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB Circular A-21.
Accordingly, such rates shall be applied to the extent provided in such Circular to
grants, contracts and other agreements to which OMB Circular A-21 is applicable,
subject to any limitations in part A of this section.  Copies of this document may
be provided by either party to other Federal agencies which have or intend to issue
or award grants and contracts using these rates or to otherwise provide such agencies
with documentary notice of this agreement and its terms and conditions.
