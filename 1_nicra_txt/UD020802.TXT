                                  DISTRIBUTION BASE

(a) Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC), as defined in OMB Circular A-21, consisting of
all salaries and wages, fringe benefits, materials and supplies, services, travel,
and subgrants and subcontracts up to the first $25,000 of each subgrant or subcontract
(regardless of the period covered by the subgrant or subcontract).  Equipment, capital
expenditures, charges for patient care and tuition remission, rental costs (for
facilities), scholarships, and fellowships as well as the portion of each subgrant and
subcontract in excess of $25,000 shall be excluded from modified total direct costs. 

                                  APPLICABLE TO

(1) Applies to all Non-DOD instruments, all DOD grants, and all DOD contracts awarded
before November 30, 1993 (See Section II, paragraph G).  (Capped)

(2) Applies only to DOD contracts awarded on or after November 30, 1993 in accordance
with and under the authority of DFARS 231.303 (1) (See Section II, paragraph G).
(Uncapped)

SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                                                                       
A.  LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I of this agreement is
expressly subject to any statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable
to a given grant, contract, or other agreement only to the extent that funds are
available and consistent with any and all limitations of cost clauses or provisions,
if any, contained therein.  Acceptance of any or all of the rates agreed to herein
is predicated upon all the following conditions: (1) that no costs other than those
incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in its indirect cost pool as finally
accepted and that all such costs are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and
allowable under the governing and applicable cost principles; (2) that the same costs
that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that
similar types of costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4)
that the information provided by the contractor/grantee, which was used as the basis
for the acceptance of the rate(s) agreed to herein and expressly relied upon by the
Government in negotiating and accepting the said rates, is not subsequently found to
be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The rates contained in Section I of this agreement are based on
the accounting system in effect at the time this agreement was negotiated. Changes to
the method(s) of accounting for costs which affects the amount of reimbursement
resulting from the use of these rates requires the express and written approval of the
authorized representative of the cognizant negotiating agency for the Government prior
to implementation of any such changes.  Such changes include but are not limited to
changes in the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct.
Failure on the part of the grantee/contractor to obtain the required approval may
result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C.  FIXED WITH CARRY-FORWARD RATES: The fixed rates contained in this agreement are
based on estimates of the costs for FY 2002. When actual costs for this fiscal year
are determined, adjustments will be applied to the next subsequent rate negotiation
to recognize the difference between the FY 2002 estimated costs used to establish
the fixed rates and the negotiated actual FY 2002 costs. 

D. PROVISIONAL RATES: The provisional rates contained in this agreement are subject to
unilateral amendment by the Government or bilateral amendment by the contracting parties
at any time. 

E. OFF- CAMPUS: A project is considered off-campus if the activity is conducted at
locations other than in university owned or supported facilities and indirect costs
associated with physical plant and/or library are not considered applicable to the
project.

F. USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES: The rates set forth in Section I hereof were
negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB Circular
A-21. Accordingly, such rates shall be applied, to the extent provided in such
circular, to grants and contracts to which OMB Circular A-21 is applicable,
subject to any limitations in part A of this section. Copies of this document
may be provided by either party to other Federal agencies which have or intend
to issue or award grants and/or contracts to Utah State University to use the
stated rates or to otherwise provide such agencies with documentary notice of
this agreement and its terms and conditions. 
        
G.  APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DOD CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS:  In
accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless waived by the institution)
may be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs
incurred by an institution of higher education under a DOD contract awarded on
or after November 30, 1993, unless the same limitation is applied uniformly to
all other organizations performing similar work.  It has been determined by
the Department of Defense that such limitation is not being uniformly applied.
 Accordingly, the rates cited (2) of Section I, as explained under the title
"APPLICABLE TO" do not reflect the application of the 26% limitation on
administrative indirect costs imposed by OMB Circular A-21, whereas
(1) does so.

H. SPECIAL REMARKS: The Government's agreement with the rates set forth in Section I is
not an acceptance of Utah State University's accounting system, cost classifications,
allocation methodologies, and proposed accounting changes included in the University's
April 9, 2001 FY 2002 forward pricing proposal and supporting data.  Any reliance by the
Government on cost data or methodologies submitted by Utah State University is on a
non-precedence-setting basis and does not imply Government acceptance.  The parties will
continue to address any differences regarding accounting systems, cost classifications,
allocation methodologies, and proposed accounting changes, as well as resolve any cost 
mpact adjustments, as necessary.  The parties will attempt to resolve these differences
before finalization of FY 2002 actual costs.
