SECTION II - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                                                                  

A. LIMITATIONS: Use of the rates set forth under Section I is subject to any statutory
or administrative limitations and is applicable to a given grant, contract or other
agreement only to the extent that funds are available and consistent with any and
all limitations of cost clauses or provisions, if any, contained therein.  Acceptance
of any or all of the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon all the following
conditions: (1) that no costs other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were
included in its indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that all such costs are
legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under governing cost
principles; (2) that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not
claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs, in like circumstances,
have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) that the information
provided by the contractor/grantee, which was used as the basis for the acceptance of
the rates agreed to herein and expressly relied upon by the Government in negotiating
the said rates, is not subsequently found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B. ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The rates contained in Section I of this agreement are based on
the accounting system in effect at the time this agreement was negotiated. Changes to
the method(s) of accounting for costs, which affects the amount of reimbursement
resulting from the use of these rates, require the written approval of the authorized
representative of  the cognizant negotiating agency for the Government prior to
implementation of any such changes.  Such changes include but are not limited to
changes in the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct.
Failure to obtain such approval may result in subsequent cost disallowances.

C. FIXED RATES WITH CARRY-FORWARD PROVISIONS:  The fixed rates contained in this agreement
are based on estimates of the costs for FY 2002. When actual costs for this fiscal year
are determined, adjustments will be applied to the next subsequent rate negotiation to
recognize the difference between the FY 2002 estimated costs used to establish the
fixed rates and the negotiated actual FY 2002 costs.

D. PREDETERMINED RATES:  The predetermined rates contained in this agreement are not
subject to adjustment in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21, subject to
the limitations contained in Part A of this section. 

E. Carry Forward Amounts: The following carryforward amounts were considered in the
establishment of the FY 2002 rates.

                           	FY 1999	FY 2000

final negotiated FY 1999 carry-forward amount and the estimated carry-forward
amount included in the FY 2001 fixed rate.

Note (b): The estimated FY 2000 carry-forward amounts will be included in the
FY 2002 rates. After the FY 2000 rates are finalized, any difference between the
estimated FY 2000 carry-forward amount and the actual carry-forward amount will
be included as an adjustment in a subsequent year rate negotiation.

F. APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DoD CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS:  In accordance
with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless waived by the institution) may be placed
on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred by an institution
of higher education under a DOD contract awarded on or after November 30, 1993, unless
the same limitation is applied uniformly to all other organizations performing similar
work.  It has been determined by the Department of Defense that such limitation is not
being uniformly applied.  Accordingly, the rates cited (2) of Section I, as explained
under the title "APPLICABLE TO" (2), do not reflect the application of the 26%
limitation on administrative indirect costs imposed by OMB Circular A-21 where as
(1) does so.

G. USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in Section I hereof were
negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB Circular
A-21.  Accordingly, such rates shall be applied to the extent provided in such
circular to grants and contracts to which OMB Circular A-21 is applicable, subject
to any limitations in part A of this section. Copies of this document may be
provided by eitherparty to other Federal agencies which have or intend to issue
or award grants and contracts using these rates or to otherwise provide such
agencies with documentary notice of this agreement and its terms and conditions. 

H. SPECIAL REMARKES:  The Government's agreement with the rates set forth in
Section I is not  an acceptance of the Pennsylvania State University's (PSU)
accounting treatment of the Intellectual Property Office costs, nor of the
proposed Revision Number 7 to PSU's Disclosure Statement, dated April 30, 2001
as relates to a change from use allowance to depreciation and a change related
to telecommunication expenses. Any reliance by the Government on cost data or
methodologies submitted by PSU is on a non-precedence-setting basis and does not
imply Government acceptance. The parties will continue to address these issues,
as well as resolve any cost impact adjustments, as necessary. The parties will
attempt to resolve these issues before finalization of the FY 2002 actual costs.
