SECTION II: GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

A.  LIMITATION: Use of the rates contained in this agreement is subject to
any statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable to a given
grant or contract only to the extent that funds are available.  Acceptance
of the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon the following conditions:
(1) that no costs other than those incurred by the contractor/grantee were
included in this indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that such costs
are legal obligations of the contractor/grantee and allowable under
governing cost principles; (2) that the same costs that have been treated
as indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types
of costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) the
information provided by the institution which was used as a basis for
acceptance of the rate agreed to herein and expressly relied upon by the
Government in negotiating and accepting the said rate is not subsequently
found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B. ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The rates contained in this agreement are based on
the accounting system in effect at the time this agreement was negotiated.
Changes to the method of accounting for costs which affect the amount of
reimbursement resulting from the use of this rate requires the approval
of the authorized representative of the cognizant agency.  Such changes 
include, but are not limited to, changes in the charging of a particular
type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure to obtain approval may
result in cost disallowances.

C.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates in Section I  hereof  were
established in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB
Circular A-21.  Accordingly, such rates shall be applied to the extent
provided in such circular to grants and contracts to which OMB Circular
A-21 is applicable, subject to any limitations in part A of this section.
Copies of this document may be provided by either party to other Federal
agencies which have or intend to issue or award grants and contracts
using these rates or otherwise provide such agencies with documentary
notice of this agreement and its terms and conditions.

D. PREDETERMINED RATES: The predetermined rates contained in this
agreement are not subject to adjustment in accordance with the
provisions of OMB Circular A-21, subject to the limitations contained
in Part A of this section.

E. SPECIAL REMARKS  

APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DOD CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS:
In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitations (unless waived by the
institution) may be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable
indirect costs incurred by an institution of higher education under a
DOD contract awarded on or after November 30, 1993, unless the same
limitation is applied uniformly to all other organizations performing
similar work.  It has been determined by the Department of Defense
that such limitation is not being uniformly applied.  Accordingly,
the rates cited (2) in Section I, as explained under the title
“APPICABLE TO” do not reflect the application of the 26% limitation
on administrative indirect costs imposed by OMB Circular A-21 whereas
(1) does so.
