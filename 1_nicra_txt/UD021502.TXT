SECTION II: GENERAL

A.  LIMITATIONS: Use of the rates contained in this Agreement is subject to any 
statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable to a given grant or
 contract only to the extent that funds are available.  Acceptance of the rates
agreed to herein is predicated upon the following conditions:  (1) that no costs
other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in this
indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that such costs are legal obligations
of the grantee/contractor and allowable under governing cost principles: (2) that
the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct
costs; (3) that similar types of costs have been accorded consistent accounting
treatment; and (4) that the information provided by the grantee/contractor which
was used  as a basis for acceptance of the rates agreed to herein is not
subsequently found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The rates contained in this Agreement are based on the
accounting system in effect at the time the agreement was negotiated.  Changes to 
the method of accounting for costs, which affect the amount of reimbursement
resulting from the use of these rates require the prior approval of the authorized
representative of the cognizant negotiation agency.  Such changes include, but are
not limited to changes in the charging of a particular type of cost from indirect
to direct.  Failure to obtain such approval may result in subsequent cost
disallowances.

C.  FIXED RATES:  Each fixed rate in this agreement is based on an estimate of the 
costs for the period covered by the rate.  When actual costs for this period are 
determined, an adjustment may be made to a rate of a future year to recognize the 
difference between the estimated costs used to establish the fixed rate and the 
negotiated actual costs.

D.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates contained herein were negotiated in
accordance with the authority set forth in OMB Circular A-21, and should be applied
to grants and contracts to which OMB Circular A-21 applies,  subject to any 
limitations in paragraph A. above.  Copies of this document may be provided by the 
Institution to other Federal Agencies having grants and contracts using these rates
as a means of providing them with early notification of the agreement contained
herein.

E.  APPLICATION OF INDIRECT COST RATES TO DOD CONTRACTS/SUBCONTRACTS:  
In accordance with DFARS 231.303, no limitation (unless waived by the institution)
may be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred
by an institution of higher education under a DoD contract awarded on or after 
November 30, 1993, unless the same limitation is applied uniformly to all other 
organizations performing similar work.  It has been determined by the Department
of Defense that such limitation is not being uniformly applied.  Accordingly, the
rates cited (1) of Section I, as explained under title “APPLICABLE TO” (1), do not
reflect the application of the 26% limitation on administrative indirect costs
imposed by OMB A-21, whereas (2) does so.

F.  LIQUIDATION OF PRIOR YEAR CARRYFORWARD (CFW) AMOUNTS:

1. F&A Rates:  The F&A rates set forth herein include adjustments for the 
following   finalized FY 1986-1996 (excluding FY 1993) carry-forward amounts and
the estimated  FY 1997 carry-forward amounts:

2. Fringe Benefit Rates: The Fringe Benefit rates set forth herein include 
adjustments for estimated FY 1999 and FY 2000 carry-forward amounts. The FY 
2002 Full Time rate of 24.30% set forth herein includes an adjustment for the 
estimated carry-forward amounts as shown below:

G.  QUALIFICATIONS; 

1. The purpose of this agreement is to establish fixed F&A cost rates and  
fixed/predetermined Fringe Benefit rates for the period 1 July 2001 through
30 June 2002.  Rates established in Section I above are based on Carnegie Mellon
University’s proposal dated April 2, 2001.  The establishment of these rates by
the Government, based on the accounting systems and allocation methodologies
contained in this proposal, does not represent an agreement that these systems
and methodologies are accepted for FY 2002, or for any subsequent fiscal year’s
rate negotiation.  The recommendations of the Defense Contract Audit Agency,
Pennsylvania Branch in Audit Report No. 6701-2001G2300002 dated July 18, 20001
were considered during the negotiation of these rates.
 	
2. Carnegie Mellon is not making any concession or admission about the 
classification or allocation of certain costs, nor is it agreeing to a similar
treatment of these costs in the future.
