SECTION II:  LIMITATIONS

A. LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I of this agreement is
expressly subject to any statutory or administrative limitations and is applicable
to a given grant, contact, or other agreement only to the extent that funds are
available and consistent with any and all limitations of cost clauses or
provisions, if any, contained therein.  Acceptance of any or all of the rates
agreed to herein is predicated upon all the following conditions:  (1) that no
cost other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were included in its
indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that all such costs are legal
obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under the governing and
applicable cost principles; (2) that the same costs that have been treated as
indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of costs
have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) that the information
provided by the contractor/grantee, which was used as the basis for the acceptance
of the rates agreed to herein and expressly relied upon by the Government in
accepting the said rates, is not subsequently found to be materially incomplete
or inaccurate.

B.  ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  The fixed rates contained in Section I of this agreement
are based on the accounting system in effect at the time this agreement was issued.
 Changes to the method(s) of accounting for costs which affects the amount of
reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates requires the express and
written approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant negotiating
agency for the Government prior to implementation of any such changes.  Such
changes include but are not limited to changes in the charging of a particular
type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure on the part of the grantee/
contractor to obtain the required approval may result in subsequent cost
disallowances.

C.  FIXED RATES WITH CARRY-FORWARD PROVISIONS:  The fixed rates contained in
this agreement are based on estimates of costs for FY 2002.  When actual costs
for FY 2002 are determined, over or under recoveries may be included as an
adjustment to the next rate negotiations to recover the difference between the
FY 2002 estimated costs use to establish the fixed rates and the negotiated
FY 2002 actual costs.

D. CARRY-FORWARD AMOUNTS:  The fixed rates set forth in Section I of this
agreement are inclusive of carry-forward amounts as follows:

		                      (Over)/Under 
		                       Recovery 
		                      Liquidated in 
	                   Year	        FY 2002

E.  USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  The rates set forth in Section I hereof
were negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB
Circular A-122.  Accordingly, such rates shall be applied, to the extent
provided in such circular, to grants and contracts to which OMB Circular
A-122 is applicable, subject to any limitations in part A of this section.
Copies of this document may be provided by either party to other Federal
agencies which have or intend to issue or award grants and/or contracts to
the Smithsonian Institution to use the stated rates or to otherwise provide
such agencies with documentary notice of this agreement and its terms and
conditions.  

F.  SPECIAL REMARKS:  The Government's agreement with the rates set forth
in Section I is not an acceptance of the institution's proposed accounting
changes regarding the treatment of year-end liability for leave and the
change in capitalization threshold, which are pending audit and approval.
The parties will address any differences regarding the proposed accounting
changes, as well as resolve any cost impact adjustments, as necessary, prior
to the finalization of the FY 2002 actual costs.  In addition, the fixed
rates herein are inclusive of an estimate for the equipment write-off for
assets affected by proposed change in capitalization threshold.
