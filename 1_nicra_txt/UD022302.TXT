in its indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that all such costs are legal
obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under the governing and
applicable cost principles; (2) that the same costs that have been treated 
as indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that similar types of
costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment; and (4) that the
information provided by the contractor/grantee, which was used as the basis
for the acceptance of the rates agreed to herein and expressly relied upon by
the Government in accepting the said rates, is not subsequently found to be
materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B. ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The provisional rates contained in Section I of this
agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at the time this

which affects the amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates
requires the express and written approval of the authorized representative of
the cognizant negotiating agency for the Government prior to implementation of 
any such changes.  Such changes include but are not limited to changes in the
charging of a particular type of cost from indirect to direct.  Failure on the
part of the grantee/contractor to obtain the required approval may result in
subsequent cost disallowances.

C. USE BY OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES: The rates set forth in Section I hereof were 
negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB Circular
A-122. Accordingly, such rates shall be applied, to the extent provided in such
circular, to grants, contracts and/or cooperative agreements to which OMB
Circular A-122 is applicable, subject to any limitations in part A of this
section. Copies of this document may be provided by either party to other
Federal agencies, which have or intend to issue or award grants, contracts,
