SECTION II: LIMITATIONS

A. LIMITATIONS:  Use of the rates set forth under Section I of this agreement is
expressly subject to any statutory or administrative limitations and is
applicable to a given grant, contract, or other agreement only to the extent
that funds are available and consistent with any and all limitations of cost
clauses or provisions, if any, contained therein.  Acceptance of any or all of
the rates agreed to herein is predicated upon all the following conditions: (1)
that no costs other than those incurred by the grantee/contractor were
included in its indirect cost pool as finally accepted and that all such costs
are legal obligations of the grantee/contractor and allowable under the
governing and applicable cost principles; (2) that the same costs that have
been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct costs; (3) that
similar types of costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment;
and (4) that the information provided by the contractor/grantee, which was
used as the basis for the acceptance of the rate(s) agreed to herein and
expressly relied upon by the Government in accepting the said rates, is not
subsequently found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate.

B. ACCOUNTING CHANGES: The fixed rates contained in Section I of this
agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at the time this
agreement was issued.  Changes to the method(s) of accounting for costs
which affects the amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of these
rates requires the express and written approval of the authorized
representative of the cognizant negotiating agency for the Government
prior to implementation of any such changes.  Such changes include but
are not limited to changes in the charging of a particular type of
cost from indirect to direct.  Failure on the part of the grantee/
contractor to obtain the required approval may result in subsequent
cost disallowances.

C.  FIXED RATES WITH CARRY-FORWARD PROVISIONS: The fixed rates contained
in this agreement are based on estimates of the costs for FY 1999 and
FY 2000.  When actual costs for FY 1999 are determined, over or under
recoveries may be included as an adjustment to the next rate negotiation
to recover the difference between the FY 1999 estimated costs used to
establish the fixed rates and the negotiated FY 1999 actual costs.
When actual costs for FY 2000 are determined, over or under recoveries
may be included as an adjustment to the next rate negotiation to recover
the difference between the FY 2000 estimated costs used to establish the
fixed rates and the negotiated FY 2000 actual costs.

this agreement are inclusive of carry-forward amounts as follows:

were negotiated in accordance with and under the authority set forth in OMB

provided in such circular, to grants and contracts to which OMB Circular
A-122 is applicable, subject to any limitations in part A of this section.
