Section II - Particulars

SCOPE: The indirect cost rate(s) contained herein are for use with grants, contracts, and other
financial assistance agreements awarded by the Federal Government to the Valencia Community
College and subject to OMB Circular A-21.

LIMITATIONS: Application of the rate(s) contained in this Agreement is subject to all statutory
or administrative limitations on the use of funds, and payment of costs hereunder is subject to the
availability of appropriations applicable to a given grant or contract.  Acceptance of the rate(s)
agreed to herein is predicated on the conditions: (A) that no costs other than those incurred by the
Valencia Community College were included in the indirect cost pools as finally accepted, and that
such costs are legal obligations of the Organizations and applicable under the governing cost
principles; (B) that the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as direct
costs;   that similar types of information which are provided by the Organization, and which were
used as a basis for acceptance of rates agreed to herein, are not subsequently found to be
materially incomplete or inaccurate; and (D) that similar types of costs have been accorded
consistent accounting treatment.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES: If a fixed or predetermined rate is in this Agreement, it is based on
the accounting system purported by the institution to be in effect during the Agreement period. 
Changes to the method of accounting for costs which affect the amount of reimbursement
resulting from the use of the Agreement require prior approval of the authorized representative of
the cognizant agency.  Such changes include, but are not limited to, changes in the charging of a
particular type of costs from indirect to direct.  Failure to obtain approval may result in cost
disallowance.

FIXED RATES: If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an estimate of the costs for the
period covered by the rate.  When the actual costs for this period are determined, an adjustment
will be made to a rate of a future year(s) to compensate for the difference between the costs used
to establish the fixed rate and actual costs.

NOTIFICATION OF OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES: Copies of this document may be
provided to other
Federal agencies as a means of notifying them of the agreement contained herein.

OTHER: If any Federal contract, grant or other agreement is reimbursing indirect costs by a
means other than the approved rate(s) in this Agreement, the institution should (1) credit such
costs to the affected programs, and (2) apply the approved rate(s) to the appropriate base to
identify the proper amount of indirect costs allocable to these programs.
