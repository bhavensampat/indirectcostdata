__________________________________________________________________________
                                                                        
Section II - Particulars                                                   

SCOPE:  The indirect cost rate(s) contained herein are for use with grants,
contracts, and other financial assistance agreements awarded by the Federal
Government to the Rogers College and subject to OMB Circular A-21.

LIMITATIONS:  Application of the rate(s) contained in this agreement is
subject to all statutory or administrative limitations on the use of funds,
and payment of costs hereunder is subject to the availability of
appropriations applicable to a given grant or contract.  Acceptance of the
rate(s) agreed to herein is predicated on the conditions:  (A) that no costs
other than those incurred by the Organization were included in indirect cost
pools as finally accepted, and that such costs are legal obligations of the
Organization and applicable under the governing cost principles; (B) that
the same costs that have been treated as indirect costs are not claimed as
direct costs; (C) that similar types of information which are provided by
the Organization, and which were used as a basis for acceptance of rates
agreed to herein, are not subsequently found to be materially incomplete or
inaccurate; and (D) that similar types of costs have accorded consistent
accounting treatment.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES:  Fixed or predetermined rates contained in this
agreement are based on the accounting system in effect at the time the
agreement was negotiated.  When changes to the method of accounting for cost
affect the amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of these rates,
the changes will require the prior approval of the authorized representative
of the cognizant negotiation agency.  Such changes include, but are not
limited to, changing a particular type of cost from an indirect to a direct
charge.  Failure to obtain such approval may result in subsequent cost
disallowances.

FIXED RATE:  The negotiated rate is based on an estimate of the costs which
will be incurred during the period to which the rate applies.  When the
actual costs for such period have been determined, an adjustment will be
made in a subsequent negotiation to compensate for the difference between
the cost used to establish the fixed rate and the actual costs.

NOTIFICATION TO OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES:  Copies of this document may be
provided to other Federal agencies as a means of notifying them of the
agreement contained herein.

AUDIT:  If any Federal contract, grant or other agreement is reimbursing
indirect costs by a means other than the approved rate(s) in this Agreement,
the institution should (1) credit such costs to the affected programs, and
(2) apply the approved rate(s) to the appropriate base to identify the
proper amount of indirect cost allocable to these programs.

Section III - Special Remarks
