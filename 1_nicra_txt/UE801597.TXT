Section II - Particulars 

SCOPE: The indirect cost rate(s) contained herein are for use with grants, 
contracts, and other financial assistance agreements awarded by the Federal 
Government to the Organization and subject to OMB Circular A-21.

LIMITATIONS: Application of the rate(s) contained in this Agreement is subject 
to all statutory or administrative limitations on the use of funds, and payment 
of costs hereunder is subject to the availability of appropriations applicable 
to a given grant or contract. Acceptance of the rate(s) agreed to herein is 
predicated on the conditions: (A) that no costs other than those incurred by the 
Miami-Dade Community College were included in the indirect cost pools as finally 
accepted, and that such costs are legal obligations of the Organization and 
applicable under the governing cost principles; (B) that the same costs that 
have been treated as indirect cost are not claimed as direct costs; (c) that 
similar types of information which are provided by the Organization, and which 
were used as a basis for acceptance of rates agreed to herein, are not 
subsequently found to be materially incomplete or inaccurate; and (D) that 
similar types of costs have been accorded consistent accounting treatment. 

ACCOUNTING CHANGES: If a fixed or predetermined rate is in this Agreement, it is 
based on the accounting system purported by the institution to be in effect 
during the Agreement period. Changes to the method of accounting for costs which 
affect the amount of reimbursement resulting from the use of this Agreement 
require prior approval of the authorized representative of the cognizant agency. 
Such changes include, but are not limited to, changes in the charging of a 
particular type of costs from indirect to direct. Failure to obtain approval may 
result in cost disallowance.

FIXED RATES: If a fixed rate is in this Agreement, it is based on an estimate of 
the costs for the period covered by the rate. When the actual costs for this 
period are determined, an adjustment will be made to a rate of a future year(s) 
to compensate for the difference between the costs used to establish the fixed 
rate and actual costs.

NOTIFICATION TO OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES: Copies of this document may be provided 
to other Federal agencies as a means of notifying them of the agreement 
contained herein.

OTHER: If any Federal contract, grant or other agreement is reimbursing indirect 
costs by a means other than the approved rate(s) in this Agreement, the 
institution should (1) credit such costs to the affected programs, and (2) apply 
the approved rate(s) to the appropriate base to identify the proper amount of 
indirect costs allocable to these programs.
