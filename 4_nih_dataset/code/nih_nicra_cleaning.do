	Order of Operations for this file:
	 
	1.	Identify and capture "subinstitutions" of interest. Subinstitutions are
		those institutions that are part of a larger organization that we may 
		wish to consider separately from the larger organization. For example, 
		the agreements for Penn State University includes separate rates for the 
		Hershey Medical Center (HMC) and Penn State as a larger organization. 
		Because HMC receives a large number of grants and has its own ICR rate, 
		we want to separate HMC from Penn State for our analysis.
		 
	2.	Standardize institution names. The agreements do not uniformly use 
		consistent naming conventions for the same institution. The final 
		product of this step is to ensure that each unique institution has a 
		uniquely identifying name in the data. In some cases, this assignment is
		straightforward (e.g., "UNIV. OF TENNESSEE OF MARTIN" and "UNIVERSITY OF 
		TENNESSEE OF MARTIN" are clearly the same institution). In other cases, 
		assignment is not obvious and had to be confirmed using another field or
		by hand (e.g., their were two CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE entries, one
		in Washington, DC and the other in Columbus, OH).
	
	3.	Subset the data. We isolate a set of "important" institutions, which we
		are calling "relevant" institutions. Within those relevant institutions
		we keep the on campus/on site rates. 
		
	4.	Reshape the data and remove overlapping rates. Because the rates are not 
		presented over standardized time frames, we reshape the data so that 
		each row presents a single institution-year-month grouping. Becuase 
		there are some cases where a new agreement comes into effect before the 
		previous agreement expires, we also remove overlaps in the data (i.e., 
		when there exists more than one institution-year-month grouping, we keep 
		the rate associated with the most recent agreement). 

	5.	Add foia2 data. To get a longer panel and broader coverage, we include
		rates from a second HHS foia request. Unlike foia1, we do not have the 
		underlying agreements for the rates, but instead receive a single rate
		per institution per year. Because we do not know which ICR rate HHS 
		provided in the foia2 source and because we use institution-year-month 
		groups for the foia1 data, we use the following method to match foia2
		institution-year pairs to the foia1 institution-year-month rates: 
		
		a.	Expand the foia2 rates to 12 months (starting in January and ending 
			in December of the year given by the foia2 source). 
		b. 	Iteratively lag the rates by one month (starting with no lag) and 
			match to foia1 rates (using institution-year-month groups).
		c.	If the match is perfect (i.e., where there is overlap, the foia2 
			rates perfectly match the foia1 rates), we keep that match. 
		d.	For those matches where the match is not perfect, repeat the process
			for the next iteration of the lag.

	Operation 01: Identify and capture subinstitutions. 
		
	Each agreement indentifies rate characteristics using the following fields: 
	location, applicable, and special_remark. Depending on the agreement, any 
	one of these fields (or a combination of these fields) may provide 
	information identifying subinstitutions. Because of this, we must consider 
	and change these fields as if they were a single unit. 
	
	To simplify this process for ourselves, we first create "new" fields where 
	we populate the corrected information. We then replace the "old" information 
	with the new information after all the "new" fields have been updated. The 
	benefit of this approach is that we can reuse the same if statement criteria
	when changing each of the fields. 
	
	In some cases, the correct information for the updated field may be remove 
	whatever information originally populated that field. Because of this (and 
	in conjunction with the approach described in the previous paragraph) we 
	create the "flag" fields, which identify all observations that we wish to 
	change (including those where the change amounts to replace field = ""). 
	
	After the changes have been made, we drop the "new" and "flag" fields.

	Operation 04: Reshape the data  
	
	Unfortunately, the code for this section is not easy to follow. Broadly, 
	each agreement covers somewhere between one to five years with each rate 
	within an agreement covering between three months to five years. To further
	complicate things, agreements and the individual rates therein start at 
	different times and sometimes overlap (i.e., a more recent agreement may 
	supercede the previous agreeemnt). Because we require a dateset where each 
	observation is comparable, we chose to reshape the data so that each row 
	represents a unique institution-year-month grouping. When overlaps occur 
	between agreements, we keep the most recent agreement for the timeframe of 
	the overlap. 
	
	We perform this reshaping in three steps: 
	
	1.	We break each effective_from-effective_to pairs into at most one year 
		spans. This makes it easier to break the spans into months. 
	2.	We expand each of the one year spans into months to arrive at the 
		institution-year-month grouping.
	3.	We remove the overlapped observations. That is, when there are two 
		duplicated institution-year-month groupings, we keep the group from the
		most recent agreement (using agreement_date).

/* 

The following code matches foia2 rates to the existing nicra agreement rates 
starting in July of a given foia2 year and ending in June of the following year
(we determined that these were the most common start and end months for the 
agreement rates). After matching, the code keeps those observations where (a) 
there is at least one overlap between nicra and foia2 rates for a given 
month-year pair and (b) the number of exact matches exceed some specified 
threshold amount of accuracy (e.g., 100% or 90%). 

We leave this code in place in case of future need, but instead we opted to use
the flexible matching system below.
